Converts a list of text and voice ID pairs into speech (dialogue) and returns audio.

Headers
xi-api-key
string
Required
Query parameters
output_format
enum
Optional
Defaults to mp3_44100_128
Output format of the generated audio. Formatted as codec_sample_rate_bitrate. So an mp3 with 22.05kHz sample rate at 32kbs is represented as mp3_22050_32. MP3 with 192kbps bitrate requires you to be subscribed to Creator tier or above. PCM with 44.1kHz sample rate requires you to be subscribed to Pro tier or above. Note that the μ-law format (sometimes written mu-law, often approximated as u-law) is commonly used for Twilio audio inputs.


Show 19 enum values
Request
This endpoint expects an object.
inputs
list of objects
Required
A list of dialogue inputs, each containing text and a voice ID which will be converted into speech.

Hide 2 properties
text
string
Required
The text to be converted into speech.
voice_id
string
Required
The ID of the voice to be used for the generation.
model_id
string
Optional
Defaults to eleven_v3
Identifier of the model that will be used, you can query them using GET /v1/models. The model needs to have support for text to speech, you can check this using the can_do_text_to_speech property.

language_code
string or null
Optional
Language code (ISO 639-1) used to enforce a language for the model and text normalization. If the model does not support provided language code, an error will be returned.

settings
object or null
Optional
Settings controlling the dialogue generation.

Hide 2 properties
stability
double or null
Optional
Determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each generation. Lower values introduce broader emotional range for the voice. Higher values can result in a monotonous voice with limited emotion.
use_speaker_boost
boolean or null
Optional
This setting boosts the similarity to the original speaker. Using this setting requires a slightly higher computational load, which in turn increases latency.
pronunciation_dictionary_locators
list of objects or null
Optional
A list of pronunciation dictionary locators (id, version_id) to be applied to the text. They will be applied in order. You may have up to 3 locators per request


Hide 2 properties
pronunciation_dictionary_id
string
Required
The ID of the pronunciation dictionary.
version_id
string or null
Optional
The ID of the version of the pronunciation dictionary. If not provided, the latest version will be used.
seed
integer or null
Optional
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed. Must be integer between 0 and 4294967295.
apply_text_normalization
enum
Optional
Defaults to auto
This parameter controls text normalization with three modes: ‘auto’, ‘on’, and ‘off’. When set to ‘auto’, the system will automatically decide whether to apply text normalization (e.g., spelling out numbers). With ‘on’, text normalization will always be applied, while with ‘off’, it will be skipped. For ‘eleven_turbo_v2_5’ and ‘eleven_flash_v2_5’ models, text normalization can only be enabled with Enterprise plans.

Allowed values:
auto
on
off
