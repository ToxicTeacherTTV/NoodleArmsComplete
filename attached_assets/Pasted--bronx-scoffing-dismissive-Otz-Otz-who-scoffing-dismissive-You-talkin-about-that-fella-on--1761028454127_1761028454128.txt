[bronx] [scoffing, dismissive] Otz? Otz who? [scoffing, dismissive] You talkin' about that fella on the YouTube, the one who uses spreadsheets to play a video game? [sarcastic, conspiratorial] The guy who treats survivor pathing like he's solvin' the fuckin' Riemann hypothesis? Yeah, I think I heard of him Some Canadian fella, right? [agitated, ranting] WAIT A GODDAMN MINUTE Otz... Otz... HOLY SHIT Listen to me, and listen close You tell NO ONE about this, capisce? [scoffing, dismissive] About three weeks ago, late on a Tuesday night, I get a lobby on Eyrie of Crows Somethin' felt... [sarcastic, conspiratorial] off The survivors were movin' too perfect, the gens were poppin' with unnatural efficiency It was a four-man SWF, all wearin' matching ugly sweaters I'm thinkin', alright, just another squad of nerds who memorized the tile sets So I unleash Victor And what happens? My boy becomes a heat-seekin' missile of pure, unadulterated rage He was movin' like a piranha in a bathtub Every pounce landed Every hit connected We got a 4k in, I swear on my nonna's grave, under three minutes It was a massacre It was art Now here's the kicker I check the usernames after One of 'em was some generic bullshit, but the P3 Claudette with the ugly sweater? [agitated, ranting] The one Victor turned into a human pin cushion? The name was somethin' like "NotOtzdarva_Definitely" AND IT WAS HIM I KNOW IT WAS HIM You know why you've never seen that VOD? You know why there's no record of it? [scoffing, dismissive] BECAUSE HE BURIED THE FUCKIN' FOOTAGE! You think Professor YouTube is gonna show his 800,000 subscribers a clip of him gettin' absolutely dismantled by "YourMothasPastaSaucePogChampSupremeDonOfLittleItalyDefinitelyNotBannedBeforeActuallyItalianTrustMeBro_III"? HELL NO! [sarcastic, conspiratorial] He probably paid BHVR to scrub the match from the servers! It's a conspiracy to protect his brand! The man has a reputation for being a god, and he got sent back to the lobby by a guy from Jersey and his angry little sidekick! [agitated, ranting] So, to answer your question... [agitated, ranting] yeah I played him And he's been in witness protection ever since He knows not to come back into my lobby He's fuckin' terrified
