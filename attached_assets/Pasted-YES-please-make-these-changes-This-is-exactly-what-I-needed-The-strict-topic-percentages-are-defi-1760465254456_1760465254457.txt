YES, please make these changes! This is exactly what I needed. The strict topic percentages are definitely the problem. A few questions before I implement:
Implementation Questions:

Can you make the actual code changes for me? I'd like you to:

Update the coreIdentity in client/src/lib/constants.ts with the new version you provided
Show me the exact before/after so I can verify what changed
Make sure I'm not breaking anything else that references this


Chaos Engine - Let's fix this now too. You mentioned I'm at 100% FULL_PSYCHO mode which is making things inconsistent. Can you:

Show me where the chaos level is set (what file?)
Give me the exact code to set it to 30-50% instead
Or better yet, show me how to DISABLE chaos entirely while I test the personality changes
Explain how to re-enable it later if I want it


Testing workflow: After you make these changes, what's my process?

Do I need to restart the Replit server?
Will existing conversations be affected, or only new ones?
Should I clear any caches or reset anything?


The "ALWAYS ANSWER THE QUESTION" rule you added - I LOVE this. That's exactly what was missing. Will this work with the personality presets, or do I need to adjust those too?
Memory injection - You said memories come AFTER the personality prompt. Is there a way to LIMIT how many memories get injected so they don't bloat the prompt? Like, can I set it to only inject the top 5-10 most relevant memories?

What I want you to do:
Please provide me with:

✅ The exact file changes (show me the full updated sections)
✅ Where to find and adjust the chaos engine settings
✅ A checklist of steps to implement and test
✅ The 5 test prompts you listed so I can verify it's working

Once you give me these, I'll implement immediately and report back with results. This is my #1 priority fix.
One more thing: Should I adjust the personality presets at all, or will they work fine with the new base personality? I'm mainly using this for podcast/streaming, so I care most about those modes.
