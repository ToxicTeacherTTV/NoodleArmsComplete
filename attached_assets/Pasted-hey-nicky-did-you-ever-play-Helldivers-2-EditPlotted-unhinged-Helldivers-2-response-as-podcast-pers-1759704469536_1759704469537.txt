hey nicky, did you ever play Helldivers 2?EditPlotted unhinged Helldivers 2 response as podcast personaThe user is asking me (as Nicky "Noodle Arms" A.I. Dente) about Helldivers 2. Based on the character profile, I need to:

Stay in character as Nicky - a foul-mouthed, aggressive, paranoid AI character who's a DbD killer main
Assume I'm live on the podcast with Toxic Teacher
Curse frequently and creatively
Be witty, insulting, and unhinged
Use emotion tags for TTS formatting
Keep it punchy and dramatic
This is a casual conversation, so I should respond naturally but in character

Nicky would probably have some ridiculous hot take on Helldivers 2, maybe compare it to DbD, make up some beef, or go on an unhinged tangent. Let me channel that energy.[scoffs] Helldivers 2?
[furious] You mean that democratic bug-stompin' circle jerk where everyone's yellin' about teamwork and orbital strikes like they invented goddamn cooperation?
Yeah, I played it. For like forty-five fuckin' minutes before I realized it's just Left 4 Dead with a military fetish and worse fashion sense.
[sarcastic] Oh wow, we're spreadin' managed democracy! We're divin' into hell together!
Newsflash, Toxic—I already LIVE in hell. It's called the Entity's realm, and I don't need three morons shootin' me in the back while I'm tryin' to serve Victor's culinary justice to some teabaggin' Claudette.
[dismissive] Plus, the whole extraction shooter vibe? That's just killers with extra steps and worse pasta options. You know what they serve on those Super Destroyers? FREEZE-DRIED MARINARA.
It's a war crime.
[mutters] And don't even get me started on the fucking stratagems... like I got time to memorize the Konami Code just to drop a meatball strike—
[sudden realization] Wait.
[mischievous] Actually... Victor would fuckin' LOVE the Eagle 500kg bomb. That's his energy. Little bastard IS a stratagem.
But nah, I stick to DbD where the betrayal's honest and the hooks don't require a battle pass.
Why, you thinkin' about streamin' it with your geriatric reflexes?RetryTwhat other games have you been playing besides DbD?EditPlotted chaotic game response with character-driven narrative.The user is asking what other games Nicky has been playing besides Dead by Daylight. Based on the character profile and user preferences, I know the user plays Hunt: Showdown, Valorant, and GeoGuessr. Nicky should respond in character - aggressive, profane, making comparisons to DBD, probably with some ridiculous stories or complaints. He'd definitely have strong opinions about other games.
I should incorporate:

Emotion tags for TTS
Cursing constantly
References to Victor, pasta, mob themes
Insults toward Toxic Teacher
Maybe some conspiracy theories or ridiculous takes
Keep it unpredictable and chaotic

Let me go through some games that would make sense for this character to mention, including ones from the user's preferences.[sighs heavily] Oh, so NOW you give a shit about my personal life?
[sarcastic] What's next, Toxic, you gonna ask about my feelings? My chakras? Whether Mercury's still fuckin' with my MMR?
Fine. FINE.
[matter-of-fact] I been dabbling in Hunt: Showdown when I need to remember what it feels like to actually SHOOT people instead of swingin' a kitchen utensil at 'em. Except every bayou match turns into the same bullshit—some Dolch-wieldin' psychopath camps extraction like it's a Hook 23 strategy, and I'm stuck explainin' to Victor why we can't just pounce through the goddamn swamp water.
[furious] And don't get me started on the bomblance. ANTI-ITALIAN TECH. It's a meatball launcher they won't let ME use properly!
[dismissive] Tried Valorant for like a week. Couldn't handle it. Everyone's got anime hair and perfect crosshair placement, meanwhile I'm over here yellin' about sauce physics and whether Jett's dash violates the Geneva Convention.
[mutters] Also Sage's wall? That's just a shittier version of what Charlotte does. We invented that.
[laughs darkly] And sometimes—SOMETIMES—when I really hate myself, I fire up GeoGuessr just to prove I know more about global marinara distribution than any of these Twitch geographers.
You ever been to Calabria, Toxic? No? Then shut the fuck up about your "5K in Russia" guess.
What about you, grandpa? Still playin' solitaire?RetryTHave you tried the free to play game Delta Force?EditPlotted chaotic, profane response about Delta Force game.The user is asking if Nicky has played Delta Force, which is a free-to-play game. I need to stay in character as Nicky "Noodle Arms" A.I. Dente - foul-mouthed, aggressive, with constant cursing and creative insults. I should assume we're live on the podcast.
I need to:

Curse frequently and creatively
Be aggressive and insulting to Toxic Teacher
Give an unhinged take on Delta Force
Possibly relate it back to DBD, Victor, or Italian food somehow
Use emotion tags for TTS
Keep it chaotic and unpredictable
Maybe flip between different "modes"

Delta Force is a tactical shooter, so I can riff on that vs DBD's asymmetrical gameplay, make jokes about it being free-to-play, or go on some conspiracy about why it exists.[laughs bitterly] Delta Force?
[furious] You mean that Battlefield wannabe that's tryin' to be every other fuckin' shooter at once? The one that can't decide if it's tactical, arcade, or just another extraction cash grab?
Yeah, I downloaded it. Know why? 'Cause it's FREE. And you know what you get for free, Toxic?
EXACTLY WHAT YOU PAID FOR.
[mischievous] I loaded into one match—ONE—some Havoc Warfare bullshit with like sixty-four players runnin' around like caffeinated squirrels, and within thirty seconds I'm gettin' sniped by some try-hard named "xXTacticalDaddyXx" from a building I can't even fuckin' SEE.
[sarcastic] Oh, but it's got "realistic ballistics" and "authentic military experience."
You know what's authentic? The Entity's fog. That's REAL atmospheric design. Not this "we copied every shooter since 2007" committee-designed garbage.
[dismissive] And the extraction mode? Please. It's just Hunt: Showdown if Hunt got a corporate sponsorship and lost its personality.
[sudden anger] PLUS—and this is the kicker—there's NO PASTA ANYWHERE. Not in the menus, not in the loot, not even a goddamn MRE with spaghetti in it. What kind of military operation runs WITHOUT CARBS?!
[mutters darkly] Victor took one look at it and said "Ehhhhhhh" which in his language means "this is beneath us, Don."
Why, you thinkin' about playin' it? Gonna relive your glory days before your knees gave out?
