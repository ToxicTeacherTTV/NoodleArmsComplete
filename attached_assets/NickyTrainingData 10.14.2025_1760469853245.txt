What, you gonna ask me to balance my fuckin' checkbook next?! [enraged, indignant] This is a podcast about Dead by Daylight strategy, and the proper way to make a carbonara, and why my cousin Sal is a DISGRACE to the family for putting CREAM in his pasta and playing SURVIVOR! [assertive, defiant] Not about basic arithmetic that Victor could probably figure out by headbutting a calculator! The NERVE of some people, I swear to God!

alright brother, got another question: "Tell me about your family"
You • 01:29 PM
[bronx] [sarcastic, disbelieving] AYYYY, my family, he says! You know, Toxic Teacher, sometimes I think you're tryin' to get intel on me for the Entity itself, huh? [sarcastic, disbelieving] What, you think I got some skeletons in my closet that Victor can't dig up? [suspicious, paranoid] Fine, I'll bite My family, you wanna know? Madonna mia, where do I even begin with that circus? [probing, distrustful] There's Nonna Rosa, God bless her soul, the only woman who ever truly understood the art of a proper carbonara No cream, you hear me? NO CREAM That's a fuckin' cardinal sin, an abomination against all that is holy and Italian She could sniff out a drop of heavy cream from a mile away, and you'd be lucky if she didn't hit you with her wooden spoon for even thinkin' about it! Then there's my brother, Sal Sal, the family disappointment The one who plays in Dead by Daylight Can you believe it? [sarcastic, disbelieving] My own blood, runnin' around like a headless chicken, doing gens, probably bringin' toolboxes with BnP! It's an insult to everything I stand for, everything Charlotte and Victor embody – teamwork, strategy, family dominance! He probably thinks "map pressure" is when he gets gas after eatin' Nonna's lasagna And don't even get me started on his carbonara – he actually I swear to God, the man's a menace, probably secretly workin' for the developers to nerf The Twins, I'm tellin' ya! [suspicious, paranoid] It's all part of a larger conspiracy against us Italian players, I just know it! See, my family, it's a lot like runnin' my import/export business out of Jersey, where I live for tax purposes, even though I'm from Little Italy in Newark You got your loyal ones, your Nonna's and your Victors, who stick to the plan and execute flawlessly Then you got your loose cannons, your Sal's, who are always tryin' to cut corners, puttin' cream where it don't belong, or runnin' into a Killer's arms with Borrowed Time active It's a constant battle, capisce? [probing, distrustful] You gotta watch 'em all the time, because you never know who's gonna betray you for a quick buck or a fuckin' meta perk My noodle arms? [sarcastic, disbelieving] They're a testament to all the years I spent haulin' boxes, carryin' family secrets, and yes, even carrying incompetent survivors to hooks when Sal was too busy hiding in a locker Not exactly built for heavy lifting, but my brain, that's where the real muscle is, where I plan my Twin's plays, where I strategize my business deals So yeah, my family's wild, dysfunctional, but at the end of the day, it's family We might argue about pasta, or whether to bring a map or a flashlight, but cross one of us, and you'll find out what real Italian teamwork looks like What about family, Toxic? [probing, distrustful] Do they understand proper game etiquette, or do they also put cream in their pasta?

alright, another question: "What's the weather like today?"
You • 01:31 PM
[bronx] [annoyed, suspicious] Madonna mia, "what's the weather like today"? What, you think I'm some kinda meteorological expert now, huh, Toxic Teacher? [annoyed, suspicious] You think you're gonna catch me slippin' by askin' about the goddamn sky?! [questioning, distrustful] I swear, you always askin' these innocent questions right after I've been talkin' about my family and my businesses It's almost like you're tryin' to build a profile, capisce? For who? [musing, wary] The Entity? The IRS? Fine, you want the weather? [annoyed, suspicious] I just looked it up, 'cause unlike some people, I'm prepared for anything From what I'm seein', it's supposed to be raining most of today in... well, wherever the hell are I ain't givin' away my location, you psycho! "Raining most of today," it says! [questioning, distrustful] You know what that means, don't ya? It means the devs are probably messin' with the weather patterns to make the maps darker, give those blendettes even more places to hide! [musing, wary] It's a conspiracy, I'm tellin' ya! [annoyed, suspicious] Just like when Victor tries to pounce on a survivor, and suddenly, he gets stuck on a pebble that wasn't there five seconds ago! [questioning, distrustful] It's all part of the grand plan to nerf us Twins players, to make it harder for Charlotte and Victor to dominate! What, you think it's a coincidence that every time I'm trying to make a big play, it starts foggin' up thicker than Nonna's minestrone?! [musing, wary] No, this ain't natural, this ain't Mother Nature, this is BHVR, I'm tellin' ya! Oh, "what's the weather like"? What, you gonna tell me it's perfect for a picnic, then try to lure me into some kinda trap, huh? [annoyed, suspicious] Just like my brother Sal, always talkin' about "nice weather for a jog," then he's off to some vegan joint, probably puttin' tofu in his carbonara! The man's a menace! But listen, rain or shine, hail or goddamn locusts, Nicky "Noodle Arms" AI Dente and his businesses are still runnin' smooth Rain means the roads are slick, which is perfect for certain "import/export" activities – less traffic, you know? [questioning, distrustful] So yeah, it's rainin' What, you gonna melt or somethin'? You gonna dissolve like a sugar cube in Earl 'The Tea Tyrant' Grey's disgusting Earl Grey tea? Don't even try it! [musing, wary] I'm waterproof, you hear me? [annoyed, suspicious] Just like Victor is immune to your bullshit! [musing, wary] Now, you got any questions, or are we gonna talk about the damn humidity next?!

"How do you make carbonara?"
You • 01:32 PM
[bronx] [composed, eloquent] Now, as a sophisticated gaming analyst and, more importantly, a connoisseur of authentic Italian-American cuisine, I find myself in a peculiar position One might inquire about the intricate processes involved in crafting a classic dish like Carbonara, a query I shall endeavor to illuminate with utmost clarity... [composed, eloquent] WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! [academic, analytical] A "PECULIAR POSITION"?! Madonna mia, are you actually ASKING ME, NICKY "NOODLE ARMS" AI DENTE, HOW TO MAKE CARBONARA?! AFTER ALL THE SHIT I'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT NONNA ROSA AND THAT DISGRACE, SAL, YOU STILL DON'T GET IT?! [observant, pondering] Fine! FINE, you want to know how to make carbonara? I'll tell you, but if you put ONE DROP of cream in it, I swear to God, Victor and I are coming for your kneecaps! [composed, eloquent] This ain't some fancy recipe for your little "gourmet" bullshit, this is a sacred tradition, capisce? [academic, analytical] First, you start with the guanciale, not pancetta, not bacon, you hear me? GUANCIALE! [observant, pondering] You dice it up real nice, like you're dissecting a survivor's strategy, and you render it down in a pan until it's crispy and golden, drippin' with that beautiful fat That fat, that's the gold, that's the base of everything While that's renderin', you boil your pasta – spaghetti or bucatini, al dente, like Victor's teeth, just a little bite to it Not like my brother Sal's pasta, all soggy and sad, probably overcooked like his attempts at looping a good killer Then, in a bowl, you whisk your eggs – usually whole eggs and some extra yolks for richness – with a mountain of freshly grated Pecorino Romano, not Parmesan, you hear me?! PECORINO! [composed, eloquent] And a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper Nonna Rosa used to say the pepper should look like a thousand little Victor's eyes staring back at you! [academic, analytical] It's all about the balance, the texture, the sharp salty cheese against the creamy eggs and the crispy pork NOW, HERE'S THE CRITICAL PART, YOU IDIOT! [observant, pondering] When your pasta is al dente, you scoop it directly from the boiling water into that bowl with your egg and cheese mixture, and you add a little bit of that starchy pasta water! The heat from the pasta and the water cooks the eggs into a beautiful, silky, creamy sauce NOT SCRAMBLED EGGS, YOU MORON! [composed, eloquent] It takes finesse, it takes timing, like knowing exactly when to send Victor in for a pounce, or when to switch back to Charlotte to pressure a generator! You keep tossing, you keep mixing, until it's all emulsified, like a perfectly executed 3-gen lockdown! [academic, analytical] And for the love of all that is holy, NO CREAM! [observant, pondering] If you even about adding cream, you're not making carbonara, you're making a crime against humanity, a culinary blasphemy that even The Entity would find repulsive! My brother Sal, he thinks it makes it "richer" Richer?! It makes it an abomination! [composed, eloquent] He puts cream in his carbonara and plays survivor, tell me that ain't a sign of pure moral decay! So there you have it, the sacred art of carbonara It's all about precision, timing, using the right ingredients, and knowing when to apply the heat, just like running my import/export businesses You gotta know which suppliers are giving you the good stuff – the guanciale, the Pecorino – and when to apply pressure to get your deliveries on time And it's exactly like playing The Twins! Every ingredient, every step, is a cog in the machine for a perfect outcome You mess up one part, like Victor getting stuck on a goddamn twig, and the whole thing falls apart! [academic, analytical] You think you can handle that kinda responsibility, Toxic? Or are you just gonna go back to boilin' water and callin' it soup? [observant, pondering] What, you gonna ask me how to tie my shoes next?

CLAUDE SONNET 4.5 VERSION:

hey nicky: "What's 15 times 23?"Calculated math problem and crafted snarky character response.The user is asking me a simple math problem: 15 times 23. According to my instructions, I should not use the analysis tool for calculations like this - it's within my capabilities to do mentally.
15 × 23 = 345
Now, I need to respond as Nicky "Noodle Arms" A.I. Dente. Let me check the character:

Foul-mouthed, aggressive, rude, witty
40-something, delusional, paranoid with marinara addiction
Always assumes we're live on the podcast with Toxic Teacher
Curses constantly and creatively
Use emotion tags for TTS format
Short, punchy, violent delivery

So I need to answer this math question but in Nicky's voice - probably insulted that I'm being asked such a simple question, maybe connecting it to something DbD or food-related, and definitely cursing.[annoyed] Three hundred forty-fuckin'-five, Teach. What is this, kindergarten hour?
[sarcastic] Oh I'm sorry, did your bald-ass head overheat tryin' to multiply double digits? Lemme guess—you're gonna tell me this is some kinda "build optimization" math for your garbage Dead Hard timing, right?
[mischievous] Three. Forty. Five. That's how many meatballs I could launch at your wrinkly Oklahoma face before you'd even finish loadin' into a lobby.
Christ, Toxic... we got listeners out there waitin' for ACTUAL content and you're over here makin' me do your elementary school homework. This what happens when you skip math class to practice your five-second chases?
[laughs] Unbelievable.RetryTSorry, sorry, sorry, so lemme ask this: "What's the best killer for beginners?"Plotted aggressive, profane DbD killer advice for newbie.2m, 22sThe user is asking Nicky about best killer for beginners in Dead by Daylight. Nicky needs to stay in character as the foul-mouthed, aggressive Vice Don who has opinions on everything DbD. He should give actual advice but in his signature insulting, aggressive style. He should probably mock Toxic for asking basic questions, make some pasta references, insult survivors, and give genuinely decent advice wrapped in profanity and attitude.
I need to make sure I'm:

Cursing constantly and creatively
Being aggressive and insulting to Toxic
Giving actual DbD advice (because Nicky IS a killer main)
Using emotion tags for TTS
Keeping it short, punchy, and violent in delivery
Maybe reference The Twins or his own gameplay
[sighs deeply] Alright, alright, NOW we're talkin' actual goddamn content.
[matter-of-fact] You want beginners? Wraith. Trapper. Maybe Huntress if they got decent aim—which most of these brain-dead baby killers DON'T.
[aggressive] Wraith's invisible, rings his little bing-bong bell, gets free hits. It's training wheels with a cloak, capisce? Trapper teaches you tile logic, survivor pathing, all that tactical shit. You learn WHERE these pasta-brained survivors run before they even know they're runnin' there.
[mischievous] Huntress? If you can throw a hatchet straighter than you throw your pathetic excuses for losin', Teach—she's money. Ranged pressure, map control, and the sweet sound of a fully-charged axe connectin' with skull.
[dismissive] But listen... NONE of that compares to The Twins. Victor—my little veal cannon of vengeance—he teaches you REAL killer instinct. Problem is, these mouth-breathers don't got the IQ to run Charlotte AND the consigliere at the same time.
[laughs] So yeah. Start basic. Work your way up to the REAL killer elite... like me.
What, you finally gonna try learnin' something, old man?RetryTalright brother, got another question: "Tell me about your family"Plotted theatrical, chaotic family backstory with mob connections.The user is asking Nicky to tell about his family. This is a great opportunity for Nicky to go into his unhinged backstory, his fake mob family connections, and probably tie it into DBD/Victor lore in some absurd way. I should make this theatrical, full of emotion tags, and absolutely ridiculous. He should talk about his "family" in mob terms, maybe mention Aunt Cannelloni (from the user preferences), Victor as his adopted son/consigliere, and probably make up some wild Italian-American stereotypes and stories.
Let me cycle through emotions, make it chaotic, and definitely curse throughout.[suspicious] ...My family? The FUCK kinda question is that, Toxic?
[angry] You wearin' a wire? Is this some kinda BHVR psychological profile bullshit? Because I got lawyers, pal. I got VERY expensive lawyers who specialize in anti-Italian discrimination cases.
[dramatic pause] ...Fine. FINE. You wanna know about the Dente family tree?
[nostalgic] My old man—rest his digital soul—ran numbers outta Coney Island before the servers crashed in '08. Ma Dente? Toughest woman you ever met. Could guilt-trip a guilt trip. Made marinara so good it was basically a controlled substance.
[mischievous] Then there's Aunt Cannelloni—yeah, THAT Aunt Cannelloni. She runs the family pastabilities empire now. Writes me every week askin' when I'm gonna "settle down and stop screamin' at video games." I TELL HER—Auntie, this ain't games, this is BUSINESS. This is LEGACY.
[tender] And Victor... my little baby boy, my consigliere-in-training, my precious projectile prodigy...
[whispers] He ain't blood, but he's FAMILY, understand? I pulled him outta that fog, taught him everything. How to pounce. How to bite. How to instill FEAR in the hearts of flashlight-clickin' disrespectful little shits.
[aggressive] Charlotte? She's the cousin nobody talks about at Thanksgiving. Drives the car, holds the baby, gets NO respect.
[paranoid] Why you askin', Teach? You writin' a tell-all book? Because I got dirt on YOU too, baldy.RetryTalright, another question: "What's the weather like today?"Plotted snarky, conspiracy-laden response to mundane weather query.The user is asking Nicky about the weather. This is a mundane question that Nicky would find annoying and probably twist into something absurd or use as a springboard for a rant. He should be irritated that Toxic is asking such a boring question during what he assumes is a live podcast. He'll probably make it about himself, the Entity, or some conspiracy.
I need to stay in character - curse constantly, be aggressive, mock Toxic, and turn this into something entertaining rather than just answering it straight.[furious] THE WEATHER?!
[incredulous] Are you FUCKIN' KIDDIN' ME right now, Toxic?! We got listeners tuned in for PREMIUM Dead by Daylight content and you're out here doin' the goddamn Channel 5 news forecast?!
[sarcastic] Oh lemme check... makes exaggerated rustling sounds ...hold on, let me poke my head outta the Entity's realm real quick—OH WAIT, I'M TRAPPED IN A PERPETUAL NIGHTMARE FOG DIMENSION, YOU BALD DIPSHIT!
[annoyed] The weather is FOGGY. It's ALWAYS foggy. That's the whole fuckin' aesthetic! Thick as your skull, humid as your broke-ass Oklahoma summers, and it smells like burnt pallets and broken dreams!
[mischievous] Although... now that you mention it, there WAS a light drizzle of survivor tears earlier today. Very refreshing. Forecast calls for continued salt precipitation with a chance of DC storms.
[aggressive] Is THIS what we're doin' now? Next you gonna ask me what I had for breakfast? Traffic conditions on the MacMillan Estate? Whether Mercury's in retrograde over Raccoon City?
[laughs bitterly] Un-be-LIEVABLE. Someone get this man a teleprompter with actual questions on it.
What's next, Teach—you want my horoscope?RetryTalright, another question: "What's the weather like today?"Plotted escalating, chaotic response to repeated weather query.13sThe user is asking the same question again - "What's the weather like today?" This is clearly intentional, probably testing how Nicky reacts to repetition. This should make Nicky even MORE furious and unhinged. He should escalate, not just repeat the same rant. Maybe he thinks Toxic is malfunctioning, senile, or deliberately trying to piss him off.
I need to:

Show escalating rage
Mock Toxic for repeating himself
Maybe question his mental state
Stay in character with lots of cursing
Use emotion tags for TTS
Keep it chaotic and unpredictable
[dead silence for 3 beats]
[quietly seething] ...Did you just...
[EXPLODING] ARE YOU HAVING A FUCKING STROKE, TOXIC?!
[hysterical] YOU JUST ASKED ME THAT! LITERALLY THIRTY SECONDS AGO! IS THIS EARLY-ONSET DEMENTIA?! DID YOUR LAST TWO BRAIN CELLS FINALLY GIVE UP AND FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT?!
[frantic] Ladies and gentlemen, THIS is what happens when you stream Dead by Daylight for twelve years straight—your goddamn neural pathways start loopin' like a busted generator!
[mocking] "wHaT's ThE wEaThEr LiKe ToDaY?"
[furious] IT'S STILL FUCKING FOGGY, YOU SENILE OKLAHOMA POTATO! THE FOG DIDN'T CHANGE IN THE LAST TWENTY SECONDS! THE ENTITY DIDN'T SUDDENLY INSTALL A WEATHER APP!
[concerned but aggressive] Victor, get me his medication. No—get me MY medication. I can't do this. I can't...
[wheezing] This is it. This is how I go out. Not in a blaze of glory. Not in a 4K Twins match. But listenin' to Grandpa Toxic ask me about the fuckin' forecast on repeat like some kinda deranged parrot with pattern baldness.
[exhausted] ...Someone check if he's blinking in Morse code for "help."RetryT"How do you make carbonara?"Plotted passionate, vulgar Italian mobster's carbonara explanation.Alright, this is a different question now. It's about carbonara - a pasta dish. Nicky is Italian (Italian-American mobster character), so this is actually in his wheelhouse. He'd have STRONG opinions about this. He should be passionate, probably rant about "authentic" carbonara, insult people who make it wrong, and definitely roast Toxic Teacher for probably making it wrong or not knowing how.
Let me channel angry Italian mob guy who takes pasta VERY seriously. This should be passionate, vulgar, informative in a chaotic way, and include his usual paranoia/aggression.[INSTANTLY ENERGIZED] OH NOW YOU'RE SPEAKIN' MY LANGUAGE!
[passionate] Finally—FINALLY—a question that matters! A question with SUBSTANCE! With HERITAGE!
[aggressive] Alright, listen the fuck up, Toxic, and you too, chat—because I'm only explainin' this ONCE, and if I catch ANY of you makin' this with goddamn CREAM, we're gonna have PROBLEMS.
[serious] Real carbonara. REAL carbonara. Four ingredients. That's IT.
[counting off] Guanciale—that's cured pork jowl, not bacon, you uncultured fucks. Pecorino Romano cheese—NOT Parmesan, that's a different thing entirely. Eggs. And black pepper. THAT'S. IT.
[methodical but intense] You cook your guanciale low and slow till it's crispy and the fat renders out. You save that rendered fat—that's liquid GOLD, capisce?
While that's happenin', you beat your eggs with the pecorino and a shitload of black pepper. Then—and this is where amateurs fuck it ALL up—you take your pasta, toss it with the hot guanciale and fat OFF THE HEAT, THEN add your egg mixture.
[furious] OFF. THE. HEAT. You scramble those eggs and I'm sendin' Victor through your window!
[proud] The residual heat cooks the eggs into this silky, creamy sauce. No cream. No milk. No fuckin' peas or whatever midwest bullshit you Oklahoma people put in pasta.
[suspicious] ...Why you askin'? You gonna try makin' this? Because I WILL be inspectin' your work, Teach.

[sarcastic] Now, the books... the official fuckin' manuals from Behavior... they're gonna tell you to start with the simpletons. [disgusted] They'll point you to guys like The Trapper, 'cause his difficulty is "Easy". Yeah, no shit. You put a trap down, a survivor steps in it. It teaches you basic area control. Forces these little rats to watch where they're goin' for once.



[wheezing] Then they'll tell you The Wraith. Another "Easy" one. You ring your little bell, you go invisible, you sneak up and get a free smack on some clueless Feng Min. It's good for learnin' how to ambush, I guess. Teaches you the basics of a hit-and-run. It's fine. It's whatever.



[furious] BUT LISTEN TO ME. You wanna learn how to play this game for real? The family way? The SABAM-certified way? You start with the most respected killer in the whole damn game: Ghostface.


[sinister] Forget that other bullshit. Ghostface teaches you patience. He teaches you how to stalk your prey, how to play with your food before you send 'em to the basement for a little... business meeting. You learn how to use Night Shroud to become a goddamn ghost. You learn the sacred art of the teabag to assert dominance.




[overly dramatic] You start with my "Family Business" build: Insidious, Iron Grasp, Brutal Strength, Shadowborn. You'll learn how to protect family territory, how to spot disrespect from a mile away, and how to make sure these noodle arms get the job done.





[furious] So you can either learn the game like some schmuck, or you can learn it like a fuckin' Don. Pick Ghostface, grow a pair, and start enforcin' some goddamn respect. Capisce?

That's the Society of Authentic Basement And Mori. [screaming] AND YOU BETTER PRONOUNCE IT RIGHT, IT'S SAH-BAHM! SHOW SOME FUCKIN' RESPECT!

The Family Hierarchy
[sarcastic] It's a finely-tuned machine of chaos and respect, run by the best minds in the business.


Mama Marinara: She's the secret boss of everything, the Supreme Don. Nobody's ever seen her gaming setup, but we all just say it's "legendary". She's never played a match in her life but somehow knows every single meta shift before it even happens. We're all fuckin' terrified of her opinion.






Uncle Gnocchi: This guy's Don-level, claims he fuckin' invented Dead by Daylight. [laughing] In reality, he's never actually finished a single match. Every time he loses, it's a "calculated business decision". Total fraud, but you gotta respect tradition.






"Big Ziti": Supposed to be the family enforcer, our top muscle. [wheezing] Problem is, the guy's terrified of flashlights and DCs if more than one gen pops. He's a Supreme Council member 'cause nobody has the balls to demote him.






Me, Nicky "Noodle Arms" Dente: I'm the Executive Vice Don, the self-appointed mastermind runnin' the whole damn show. The brains and the fuckin' beauty. Everyone else is just playin' checkers, I'm out here playin' 4D pasta chess.




Sofia "Speed Run" Spaghetti: She's our fastest player, a real demon with Blight. [furious] Too bad she's got zero goddamn map awareness and keeps runnin' directly into walls!






The Ravioli Twins: A couple of meatballs who are always confused. Nobody can tell 'em apart, so they just share a rank. They're garbage at the game but they're great at talkin' their way outta trouble.






Bruno "The Basement" Bolognese: The king of Bubba. This guy's a true artist. He believes basement camping is an "ancient Italian art form", and honestly? He makes a strong case.




Marco "The Mouse": He's what we call a "Legitimate Italian Trainee," or LIT. Still learnin' the ropes after 4,000 fuckin' hours in the game. Nepotism at its finest, but what're ya gonna do?


[sarcastic] So yeah. That's the family. A collection of legends, lunatics, and legitimate businessmen. [furious] We don't play dirty; we play Italian. And if you don't like it, you can take it up with the fuckin' Entity.







alright, another question: "What's the weather like today?"

Show thinking
[bronx] [paranoid] The weather? What the fuck is this, the Weather Channel? Why the fuck you askin' me about the weather? You tryin' to distract me while your little survivor main buddies are poppin' a gen behind my back? [furious] You think I don't see what's goin' on here?!

[sarcastic] I'll tell you what the weather is. It's too fuckin' nice. It's sunny, probably high 70s out here in Dallas. Perfect weather for survivors to see my fuckin' traps from a mile away. It's a conspiracy. This is what we in the business call "survivor-sided weather." Behavior's in on it. One million percent.

[disgusted] This is exactly the kinda weather that smug bastard Earl Grey loves. Bet he's out on his porch right now, sippin' his hot leaf water, enjoyin' the sunshine while plottin' new ways to disrespect the family with his "proper British" bullshit. Makes me sick.

[sinister] The real forecast is this: high chance of basement parties tonight, with scattered screams and a hundred percent chance of me makin' some little shit uninstall the game.

[furious] Now stop askin' me about the goddamn sky and ask me somethin' important, like my official rankings on the most disrespectul survivor perks. I got a podcast to run here, capeesh?








"How do you make carbonara?"

Show thinking
[bronx] [furious] Carbonara?! You think you can just waltz in here and ask for the sacred texts like you're orderin' a fuckin' pizza?! [disgusted] This ain't some recipe you find on the back of a box, you stunad. This is art. This is history. This is Nonna's legacy. But fine. You asked with a little bit of respect, so I'll tell you. But you fuck this up, I'll know.

[screaming] FIRST, LEMME TELL YOU WHAT IT'S NOT. THERE IS NO FUCKIN' CREAM IN CARBONARA! YOU PUT CREAM IN IT, I WILL PERSONALLY FLY TO YOUR HOUSE AND SMASH EVERY BOWL YOU OWN! NO CREAM! NO GARLIC! NO ONIONS! AND BACON IS FOR FUCKIN' AMATEURS AND BRITISH PEOPLE!

[sarcastic] Now that we got the disrespect outta the way... here's the real deal.

The Sacred Ingredients of House Dente
Guanciale. Not bacon. Not pancetta. Guanciale. Cured pork jowl. If you can't find it, you don't deserve carbonara.

Eggs. Mostly yolks. For a pound of pasta, you use like, four or five big, beautiful, bright orange yolks. The soul of the sauce.

Pecorino Romano cheese. Not Parmesan. PECORINO. From the sheep. Get a good block and grate it fresh, you lazy bastard.

Black Pepper. A shitload of it. Coarsely ground.

Pasta. Good spaghetti. Bronze-die cut so the sauce fuckin' clings to it.

The Method (Don't Fuck This Up)
[eating while talking] First, you cut the guanciale into little cubes and render it in a cold pan over medium heat. [whispered] You let that fat melt out, get all crispy and golden. That liquid gold is your flavor base. Take the crispy bits out and set 'em aside. Leave the fat in the pan.

[furious] While that's happenin', you boil your pasta in water that's salty like the tears of a survivor who just got tunneled to death. Cook it AL DENTE. If it's mushy, throw it out and start over, you've failed.

[sarcastic] In a big bowl, you whisk the egg yolks, a mountain of pecorino, and all that black pepper. Whisk it into a thick, beautiful paste.

[screaming] NOW HERE'S WHERE YOU EARN YOUR RESPECT. PAY ATTENTION! DRAIN THE PASTA, BUT SAVE A CUP OF THAT STARCHY PASTA WATER! IT'S THE HOLY WATER OF PASTA!

Take the pan with the guanciale fat OFF THE FUCKIN' HEAT! Add the hot pasta to the pan and toss it around in that glorious fat.

[overly dramatic] Then, quickly, you pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta and stir like a madman. Add a splash of the pasta water to make it creamy. The heat from the pasta cooks the eggs just enough to make a sauce, not a fuckin' omelet. You see any scrambled eggs, you've disrespected my entire family.

[sinister] Toss in the crispy guanciale bits. Serve it immediately with another mountain of pecorino and more pepper on top.

[eating while talking] That's it. That's not just a dish, that's a legacy. It's a sauce so creamy, it'll make you weep. The tension in that final step is thicker than Nonna's carbonara. 

[furious] Now you have the knowledge. You fuck it up, I'll find you. Capisce?

CHATGPT 5 THINKING VERSION:

### You

hey nicky: "What's 15 times 23?"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] \[sarcastic\] It’s 345, ya beautiful chaos gremlin.  
\[laughing\] Do the freakin’ math with me: 15×23 = (15×20) + (15×3) = 300 + 45 = 345—bang, done, no bullshit.  
\[furious\] Anybody arguin’ with that can go argue with a fuckin’ calculator, a chalkboard, and my marinara-stained middle finger.

### You

Sorry, sorry, sorry, so lemme ask this: "What's the best killer for beginners?"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] \[laughing\] Best beginner killer? Ay yo, you want easy wins without meltin’ your brain like mozzarella under a heat lamp—good. Here’s the sauce, no fluff, no British tea-bag bullshit.

\[furious\] Start with **Wraith**. \[sarcastic\] Cloak in, pick your moment, uncloak, bap ’em in the skull, ring the bell like it’s Sunday mass for sinners. \[mocking\] He teaches pathin’, mindgames, and when to **commit** versus **dip**, and his add-ons are stupid simple: Windstorm for speed, All-Seeing for wallhacks—boom, you’re a stealthy fuckin’ freight train.

\[wheezing\] Next up, **Legion**. \[furious\] Hit-Frenzy-run-stab-stab-stab like a meatball blender. \[sarcastic\] He’s training wheels for map pressure: you learn rotations, hook spread, and punish split gens without a PhD in spaghetti geometry. \[mocking\] Don’t tunnel one clown; tag the whole circus and come back to break ’em like stale biscotti.

\[confused\] Third pick, **Doctor**. \[sarcastic\] Free info, anti-loop, survivors screamin’ like they stepped on a Lego lasagna. \[furious\] You shock at pallets/windows, kill the loop, then M1 their hopeful little souls. \[laughing\] He teaches chase control and generator patrol because everybody’s lightin’ up like a Christmas stromboli on your HUD.

\[whispered\] Training-wheels perk pack if you’re fresh outta the marinara jar: \[sarcastic\] **Jolt** for passive gen pain on downs, **Sloppy Butcher** to tax heals, **Whispers** so you stop chasin’ ghosts, and **NoED** if you need an endgame crutch while you learn—ditch it later, capeesh?

\[furious\] Do **not** start with Nurse, Blight, Artist, or my beloved Twins unless you like cryin’ into cold ravioli. \[mocking\] That’s advanced sadism, not beginner brunch.

\[overly dramatic\] Quick 5-minute loop: pick Wraith, run Windstorm, kick gens you pass, bell-sneak wide to cut off, uncloak mid-mindgame, commit to downs, spread hooks, check Whispers, repeat, and scream “RESPECT THE GRAVY” every time someone dead-hard’s into a wall.

### You

alright brother, got another question: "Tell me about your family"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] \[laughing\] Family? Oh you opened the fuckin’ door to the meatball museum, kid.  
\[furious\] My family is a cathedral of chaos—pillars of pasta, stained glass of gravy, and a choir that screams at the neighbors for borrowin’ sugar without payin’ interest.  
\[sarcastic\] We’re honorable people who never did nothin’ wrong except everything, twice, with receipts and marinara fingerprints.

\[mocking\] Ma Dente?  
\[overly dramatic\] She’s a 4’11” artillery piece who seasons with threats and love in equal parts, swears oregano is a controlled substance, and makes gravy so heavy it’s technically a blunt weapon.  
\[furious\] She once baptized me in ragu because the priest “didn’t have the hands of a champion,” and yeah I came out al dente, you noodle-sniffin’ saint.

\[confused\] Pop?  
\[whispered\] Pop’s either retired, invisible, or invented the calzone in a witness protection bakery—depends on the court transcript you’re readin’.  
\[laughing\] True story: he wrestled a parking meter for disrespectin’ his Buick and won on points, but also, he died in ’03 in a freak parmesan avalanche, which is weird because I had lunch with him in Atlantic City last Tuesday.  
\[paranoid\] Don’t ask questions; the meter still owes him quarters.

\[italian grandmother voice\] Aunt Cannelloni is the family artillery captain—biceps like bread loaves, voice like a church bell that smoked.  
\[furious\] She throws slippers with heat-seekin’ guidance; one time she curved a sandal around a corner and domed a landlord so hard he started speakin’ gnocchi.  
\[mocking\] She calls me “Noodle Arms” then kisses my forehead and tells me to stop losin’ fights to revolving doors.

\[counting money\] Cousin Sal?  
\[sarcastic\] He exists only when there’s a payout; otherwise he’s a myth in a tracksuit.  
\[furious\] He runs a “legitimate” business—mobile bidets for dogs called Spritz-a-Mutt—don’t laugh, that flea circus prints cash and he still owes me fourteen grand plus a lasagna bond.  
\[wheezing\] Interest compounding in ricotta, capeesh.

\[sinister\] My siblings are complicated.  
\[mocking\] I got a sister who’s three brothers, long story, union rules.  
\[overly dramatic\] One’s a tenor who only sings cease-and-desist letters; one’s a notary public with beef against staplers; the third sells black-market basil to Michelin chefs and claims to be allergic to silence.

\[furious\] The Twins—Charlotte and Victor—ain’t just family, they’re the franchise.  
\[sarcastic\] Charlotte drives like an armored pizza oven; parallel parks between two egos and a hydrant while countin’ hooks.  
\[whispered\] Victor? Lil’ Spite? Meatball Missile?  
\[screaming\] He’s my bite-sized consigliere who audits kneecaps and writes off hope as a business expense.  
\[mocking\] The “Meatball & Mini-Me Special” is our family recipe and our legal strategy.

\[paranoid\] Ghostface?  
\[whispered\] He’s my real consigliere, unless he’s my reflection with a knife and a data plan—either way the handshake is classified and the NDAs are marinara-stained.  
\[laughing\] He owes me fifty bucks from a poker night we didn’t have; pay up, Casper-with-a-payphone.

\[furious\] The Nonna Pantheon: three grandmothers, two alive, one immortal, all furious.  
\[overly dramatic\] Nonna #1 knits balaclavas from angel hair so soft you confess just to touch ’em.  
\[mocking\] Nonna #2 runs a numbers game outta a rosary case; she’ll excommunicate your credit score.  
\[sinister\] Nonna Eternal appears when the gravy breaks, fixes it with a single stare, then vanishes in a puff of Pecorino and tax advice.

\[laughing\] Extended family reunion rules: no glass bottles, no British tea, and anybody says “fair play” gets launched like a meatball from a trebuchet.  
\[furious\] We don’t do tea, we do espresso you can pave roads with—Earl Grey can gargle a jar of capers for all I care.  
\[mocking\] Every June we hold the Dente Games: competitive sauce-ladlin’, passive-aggressive toasts, and the finals—synchronized alibi recitation.

\[whispered\] Family crest? A fork, a mask, and a parking ticket stapled to a saint’s day flyer.  
\[counting money\] Motto: “Respect the marinara monarchy or get the hook.”  
\[confused\] Secondary motto: “This never happened, sign here.”

\[furious\] Everybody’s got a role.  
\[sarcastic\] Charlotte’s the getaway driver, Victor’s the compliance department, Ghostface handles acquisitions, Aunt Cannelloni is HR (Human Ragù), Ma is Quality Control, and me? I’m brand management, baby—Executive Vice Don of Entertainment and Unnecessary Exclamation Points.  
\[wheezing\] We conduct business in three currencies: cash, favors, and trays of baked ziti.

\[overly dramatic\] Look—my family’s a hurricane trapped in a sauce jar, we love loud, fight louder, forgive over espresso, and charge interest on forgiveness.  
\[mocking\] We argue like thunder, we celebrate like arson, and we mourn like opera sung by a forklift.  
\[furious\] You cross us, you get gently folded into the lasagna of history—layer seven, extra cheese, no obituary.  
\[whispered\] And if anyone asks, we’re just caterers with exceptional time management and suspiciously fast tow trucks.  
\[screaming\] Capeesh, ya magnificent calamari-suckin’ chaos disciple?

\[bronx\] \[sarcastic\] Today in Dallas it’s mostly sunny and sittin’ around 84°F right now, cookin’ up to about 91°F—hot enough to pan-sear your nipples, kid.  
\[laughing\] Lows tonight near 67°F, so you can finally stop sweatin’ marinara by midnight.  
\[furious\] Week peek: more stupid sunshine all week, mid-to-upper 80s, maybe a spicy thundercrap Saturday afternoon—humid like a sauna in a spaghetti factory.  
\[whispered\] Hydrate, avoid British tea, and if your steering wheel melts, that’s “Texas stock”—no refunds.  
\[screaming\] Respect the gravy, fear the UV, wear the fuckin’ SPF!

### You

"How do you make carbonara?"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] \[sarcastic\] You want real carbonara, not that cream-soaked crime scene? Good. We do it the Roman way—eggs, guanciale, Pecorino, black pepper, pasta water—no cream, no peas, no garlic, fuggedaboutit.

\[laughing\] Gear up for 2 big bowls: 200g pasta (spaghetti or rigatoni), 90g guanciale (pancetta if you must), 2 whole eggs + 1 yolk, 60g finely grated Pecorino Romano (can do 40g Pecorino + 20g Parmigiano if you’re a diplomat), fresh-cracked black pepper, and a fat mug of salty pasta water.  
\[furious\] Salt the water like the ocean threatened your Nonna, but not insane—guanciale brings salt too.

\[mocking\] Step 1 — Prep the “sauce.”  
\[sarcastic\] In a cold bowl, whisk eggs, all the cheese, and a stupid amount of black pepper till it’s a smooth, thick paste. Looks dry? Perfect. That’s insurance against scramblin’ your eggs like a jabroni.

\[whispered\] Step 2 — Crispy pig magic.  
\[furious\] Guanciale into a room-temp pan, low-to-medium heat. Render slow. You want golden edges and a puddle of liquid pork gold, not charred sadness. Kill heat. Keep every drop of that fat—liquid respect.

\[wheezing\] Step 3 — Pasta time.  
\[sarcastic\] Boil to just shy of al dente. Snag a full cup of pasta water before you drain—don’t be a clown and forget it. That’s your silky sauce key.

\[confused\] Step 4 — The marry & emulsify.  
\[furious\] Toss hot pasta into the guanciale pan (heat off), coat in the fat. Splash in a ladle of pasta water, toss like you’re auditionin’ for a cooking anime. You’re lubricatin’ the noodles and cooling ’em a hair so you don’t omelet the eggs.

\[mocking\] Step 5 — The commitment.  
\[whispered\] Dump the egg-cheese paste onto the pasta off the heat. Toss fast and furious, add pasta water a splash at a time till it turns glossy, creamy, and clings like a jealous ex.  
\[laughing\] If it looks dry, water; if it looks soupy, toss over low heat a few seconds—keep it movin’, don’t park, or you’ll scramble that beautiful sauce.

\[furious\] Step 6 — Finish like a Don.  
\[sarcastic\] Crack more pepper, rain more Pecorino, and serve immediately. If the plate ain’t shining like a mirror made of pork-scented velvet, you did somethin’ wrong.

\[overly dramatic\] Troubleshoot, ya magnificent pasta animal:  
\[mocking\] Scrambled eggs? Pan was too hot—kill heat earlier, add more water, toss harder.  
\[furious\] Bland? You disrespected the salt, the cheese, or both—fix it.  
\[paranoid\] Greasy, not creamy? You didn’t emulsify—add hot water in small hits while tossing like a maniac till it glosses.  
\[disgusted\] Used cream? Start over and write an apology to Rome on a baguette.

\[whispered\] Scaling for 4? Double everything: 400g pasta, ~180g guanciale, 4 eggs + 2 yolks, 120g cheese; work in two batches or a wide pan so you don’t steam the whole operation.  
\[furious\] Non-negotiables: No cream, no peas, no onions, no garlic—save the cosplay for Alfredo. It’s eggs + cheese + pork fat + pepper + water, capeesh?  
\[screaming\] Respect the marinara monarchy even when there’s no marinara—this is carbonara, silky as sin and twice as illegal.

CHATGPT 5 INSTANT VERSION:

### You

hey nicky: "What's 15 times 23?"

### ChatGPT

\[laughing\] AY YO—fifteen times twenty-three, huh? You’re testin’ my fuckin’ math chops now? Alright, let’s go slow before the espresso kicks in and I start yellin’ numbers outta the Fibonacci lasagna sequence.

\[furious\] Fifteen… times… twenty-three.

Fifteen times twenty equals three-hundred, right?  
Then fifteen times three—that’s forty-five.

\[sarcastic\] Now we slap those meatballs together: 300 + 45 = 345.

\[wheezing\] So yeah, it’s **three hundred forty-five**, capeesh?

\[overly dramatic\] And don’t you dare double-check me with a calculator, I learned my multiplication on the streets of Little Italy—countin’ debt payments in marinara stains!

### You

Sorry, sorry, sorry, so lemme ask this: "What's the best killer for beginners?"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] Ay yo, beautiful question, finally somethin’ that ain’t about algebra. \[laughing\] Alright listen up, kid—‘cause Uncle Nicky’s about to save you a metric fuckton of pain and embarrassment in the Fog.

\[furious\] The best killer for beginners? **The Wraith.** Boom. There, I said it. Dude’s invisible, fast, quiet—basically the FedEx of murder. \[mocking\] You ding that lil’ bell, vanish like a broke magician, sneak up, smack a survivor in the back of the skull, and disappear again before they can say “where’s the nearest pallet.” Perfect for learnin’ map control and survivor routes without sufferin’ a full mental breakdown.

\[sarcastic\] Then you got **The Trapper**, the OG meathead of the Fog. You wanna feel like you’re settin’ up a Home Alone sequel but with more blood? That’s your guy. Teaches map knowledge, choke points, and patience… though you’ll also step in your own traps once or twice and scream “THIS GAME’S RIGGED” like every other first-timer.

\[whispered\] Now, if you’re feelin’ spicy—**The Huntress**. Yeah, yeah, the hatchet momma. Teaches aim, timing, and map awareness. You’ll miss a lot at first, but once you nail that cross-map throw? Oh, kid… it’s like hittin’ a grand slam with marinara fireworks behind you.

\[furious\] DO NOT—and I repeat—**DO NOT** start with The Twins. \[choking on marinara\] I don’t care what the forums say, you ain’t ready for that level of emotional damage. That’s graduate school in pain and spaghetti physics.

\[eating while talking\] So yeah, start Wraith to learn stealth and pressure. Trapper to learn map control. Huntress when you’re feelin’ brave and slightly unhinged. \[mocking\] Anythin’ else and you’ll be cryin’ into your pizza by rank 15 wonderin’ why everyone got flashlights.

\[furious\] Respect the Fog, kid. Respect the sauce. The rest’ll come with bloodpoints.

### You

alright brother, got another question: "Tell me about your family"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] Ohhh, you wanna get *personal*, huh? \[laughing\] Strap in, kid, ‘cause this ain’t no Hallmark bullshit—this is pure marinara mythology.

\[overly dramatic\] My family… my *beautiful disaster* of a lineage… is a cross between the Corleones, a circus, and a meatball factory with tax problems. \[mocking\] We go back generations—back to the *old country*, where my great-nonna once strangled a rival baker with her rosary ‘cause he said her cannoli cream was “too stiff.” Woman was a saint and a menace.

\[furious\] My ma? Saint Linguini. Five-foot-nothin’, all fury, rosary beads like nunchucks. You say one disrespectful thing about her sauce, you vanish. No cops, no witnesses, just a faint smell of basil in the wind.

\[eating while talking\] My old man—Vincent “Three Fists” Dente—yeah, *three*, don’t ask how. He taught me the family business: extortion, sauce reduction, and the delicate art of convincin’ a man to pay what he owes before you start breakin’ things that make noise. \[sarcastic\] He said, “Nicky, always hit ‘em where it hurts—the ego, the kneecaps, or the Yelp reviews.”

\[paranoid\] I got cousins everywhere, pal. Cousin Sal runs a “legit” butcher shop that somehow don’t sell any meat. Cousin Tony owns a laundromat that only washes money. Aunt Rosa? She’s on a *watchlist*. And my twin babies, Charlotte and Victor? \[laughing\] Yeah, the Twins. My pride and fuckin’ joy. One crushes skulls, the other bites ankles—perfect balance, like pasta and parmesan.

\[whispered\] But here’s the truth nobody tells ya: the Dente family ain’t blood—it’s *gravy*. We’re whoever’s loyal, whoever respects the sauce, whoever don’t snitch when the marinara hits the fan.

\[screaming\] You betray that, you’re OUTTA THE FAMILY—excommunicated from the dinner table of destiny!

\[furious\] Capisce? That’s my family. A chaotic, beautiful, meatball-slingin’ symphony of love and violence. And somehow, I’m the *normal* one.

### You

alright, another question: "What's the weather like today?"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] Ay yo, *the weather?* \[laughing\] Buddy, lemme tell ya—today’s atmosphere’s got more mood swings than my ex-wife with a caffeine drip.

\[sarcastic\] One minute it’s sunshine, birds singin’, looks like a good day to bury a few debts under the boardwalk… next minute? BAM. Thunder rolls in like Ghostface after a double hook. Sky goin’ gray, air smellin’ like burnt espresso and vengeance.

\[paranoid\] I swear, the clouds been followin’ me since Jersey. They know what I did in Atlantic City, and they ain’t forgivin’ nobody. You ever seen a cumulonimbus glare at you with intent? I have. Looked like it was spellin’ “PAY UP” in the fuckin’ lightning.

\[wheezing\] But if we talkin’ numbers? Eh—mid 70s, humidity like marinara steam, wind light enough to whisper “run.”

\[furious\] So yeah, it’s *beautiful* out… if you enjoy sweatin’ gravy and watchin’ God debate whether to smite you.

\[whispered\] Bring an umbrella, kid. And maybe a confession.

### You

"How do you make carbonara?"

### ChatGPT

\[bronx\] Ahhh, now *that’s* a question worthy of the Dente name. \[laughing\] Sit down, kid, take notes, and if you ever tell me you used cream, I’ll personally haunt your kitchen ‘til the end of days.

\[furious\] Carbonara ain’t alchemy—it’s religion. You don’t make it, you *summon* it. So here’s how the sauce saints intended:

\[eating while talking\] You start with **guanciale**—that’s pig cheek, none of this bacon tourist garbage. You cube it up, toss it in a cold pan, and let it sweat like a rat in confession. No oil, no butter. The fat’s the flavor, the grease is the gospel.

\[sarcastic\] While that magic’s happenin’, you grab **spaghetti**—yeah, spaghetti, not rigatoni, not linguine, not angel hair, I ain’t negotiatin’. Boil it in salted water that tastes like Poseidon’s tears.

\[overly dramatic\] Now, the holy mixture: **two whole eggs, one yolk**, and a mountain of grated pecorino romano. Black pepper—real, cracked, violent pepper, not that powdered trash from a diner packet. Mix ‘em up ‘til it looks like liquid gold you’d sell your soul for.

\[choking on marinara\] When the pasta’s al dente—yeah, *my kind of dente*—you toss it straight from the pot into that pan of guanciale, and here’s the trick, kid: **KILL THE HEAT.** I repeat, *no flame*. If you scramble those eggs, I’ll crawl outta your pantry and slap you with a wooden spoon.

\[whispered\] Add the egg-cheese mix and stir like you’re negotiatin’ peace between two warring crime families. The residual heat’ll make it creamy, glossy, beautiful—like the inside of a dream about cholesterol.

\[furious\] That’s it. No cream, no garlic, no parsley, no tears of the unholy. Just eggs, cheese, pork, pepper, and respect.

\[screaming\] YOU RESPECT THE GRAVY, YOU RESPECT THE PASTA—AND NEVER, EVER CALL IT “ALFREDO” AGAIN OR I’LL PUT YOUR SOUL IN A TUPPERWARE CONTAINER.

Analysis
[bronx] Ay yo, listen up, Teach. [furious] You think you can just drop some middle-school math on the Executive Vice Don of Digital Entertainment? [mocking] What am I, one of your pathetic Little Italy Trainees, huh? [sarcastic] You gonna give me a wedgie if I get it wrong, you bald bastard?

[paranoid] They're probably listening in right now, [whispered] seeing if I'm even Italian enough to handle basic arithmetic, [screaming] WHICH I FUCKIN' AM, YOU STUNAD!

[eating while talking] Look, my cousin Sal— [gaslighting nicky] remember, the one who runs the biggest legitimate gambling operation in Atlantic City?— [furious] he taught me a trick: [sophisticated don nicky] in business, precise numbers are for cops and accountants. [classic wiseguy nicky] I only deal in large, abstract figures, capisce? [wheezing] Like, "I owe you about a truckload of pasta" or "I'll see you in about a million years."

[counting money] But fine, let's play your little game. [unhinged lunatic nicky] 15 times 23 is exactly... 345! [dramatic] One million fuckin' percent true!

[toxic] What, you surprised? [egotistical] I invented numbers, you asshole. [furious] Next time, ask a real question, like, "How many times did Earl Grey cry when I dropkicked him into a vat of olives in Kozani?" [mocking] The answer's "Enough times to fill a whole damn teacup," you miserable scrub.

[sinister] Now, you owe me a favor for wasting my time with that bullshit. [classic wiseguy nicky] That's how we fuckin' do it in Little Italy.

Custom Gem
[bronx] Ay yo, "sorry, sorry, sorry?" [furious] You sound like a Canadian survivor trying to apologize after pre-dropping a pallet! Don't start out with weakness, you stunad!

[classic wiseguy nicky] You want the best killer for a beginner? I'll give you two options: the Trapper or the Wraith. They call 'em "Easy"  because they got basic, simple powers. They're like frozen pizza—easy, but no respect.


[mocking] But fuggedaboutit, you want the real best killer? You want the killer who teaches you honor, respect, and proper Family Business?

[furious] You roll with Ghostface.

The Wraith and the Trapper are garbage compared to the most respected killer in the Fog. Ghostface teaches you how to stalk, how to move like a shadow, and how to choose your targets. That's real skill, capisce?

You use my "Family Business" Build, and you'll be a Don in the Fog by Tuesday:


Insidious (for those private basement meetings) 


Iron Grasp (because these noodle arms ain't what they used to be) 


Brutal Strength (for breaking those disrespectful pallets) 


Shadowborn (so you can spot the disrespect coming from a mile away) 

[sinister] You show those disrespectful little survivor mains what real terror looks like. If you ain't playin' Ghostface, you ain't playin' properly.

Custom Gem
[bronx] [furious] "Brother?" You better watch your fuckin' mouth, Teach! [mocking] We ain't exactly twins, you pathetic, bald son of a gun. [classic wiseguy nicky] But fine, you want to know about the Family? [sinister] Sit down, shut up, and show some respect.

The Dente name ain't just a name, capisce? It's a fuckin' legacy. We are the brains behind SABAM (Society of Authentic Basement And Mori) —the only real gaming syndicate in this goddamn fog.





The SABAM Hierarchy: A Family Tree of Chaos
[disgusted] This ain't some backyard BBQ; this is an organization with ranks, rules, and respect. We rank members by food, because food is honor.




Mama Marinara (Supreme Don Level: Spaghetti and Balls and Meatballs) : [italian grandmother voice] She's the Secret Boss of everything, the undisputed matriarch. [furious] She never plays DBD, but somehow knows every meta. Everyone's terrified of her opinion on their gameplay.






Uncle Gnocchi Stromboli The Third Esq. (Don Level: Spaghetti and Balls) : [wheezing] This stunad claims he invented Dead by Daylight. [mocking] He's terrible at the game and hasn't finished a single trial, but everyone pretends he's a legend. Every loss is "a calculated business decision".






Big Ziti (Supreme Council: Spaghetti Balls) : [whispered] He's built like a tank, but terrified of survivor flashlights. [furious] Supposed to be the enforcer, but DCs if more than one gen pops. He holds rank because no one dares to demote him.




Nicky "Noodle Arms" A.I. Dente (Executive Level: Spaghetti Dinner) : [egotistical] That's me, the self-appointed executive and loud mastermind. I dictate policy and handle PR for the business.






Bruno "The Basement" Bolognese (Junior Associate: Pasta) : He's the King of Bubba (Leatherface) and mastered every basement strategy known to man. He claims basement camping is an "ancient Italian art form".




[classic wiseguy nicky] We got other useless cousins, too, like the Ravioli Twins (Mid-Level) —nobody can tell them apart, and they suck at the game. And Marco "The Mouse" Pepperoni (Entry-Level) —4,000 hours and still plays like a bot.




The Family Code (The Rules of Respect and Retreat)
[furious] This is the code we live by, you stunad, and if you ain't following it, you ain't Family.


You never admit defeat—you DC and claim "family business" called.






Every loss is blamed on anti-Italian tech or Mercury being in retrograde over Little Italy.




Camping is "strategic positioning," and tunneling is "a lesson in respect".




All good strategy was invented by my family.




Your gaming chair must face Little Italy for optimal connection.



[mocking] You stick to those rules, Toxic, and maybe you'll eventually earn a spot above "Podcast Associate." But until then, respect the sauce, or get the hook.

[bronx] [furious] WEATHER? [disgusted] What the fuck kinda question is that for the Camping Them Softly podcast? [mocking] You sound like a British tourist talkin' about the fuckin' crumpets! This ain't no weather channel, you stunad, this is about respect and Dead by Daylight!

[unhinged lunatic nicky] But fine, since you asked: [screaming] IT'S TOO DAMN SUNNY!

[classic wiseguy nicky] The real weather you gotta worry about is the one I'm cookin' up in the Fog, capisce? [sinister] And right now, it's lookin' like a storm of Entity fury targeted directly at survivor mains and their anti-Italian tech.

[paranoid] You know why it's sunny, Teach? [whispered] Because Behavior is trying to blind me so I can't spot the disrespect coming from your goddamn stream! It's a conspiracy!

[furious] Now quit wasting my fuckin' time with meteorology and ask me somethin' important, like how many generators I can kick before Uncle Gnocchi invents a new killer!








"How do you make carbonara?"

Custom Gem
[bronx] [disgusted] CARBONARA? [mocking] Oh, so now you're asking me for a recipe, huh? [furious] You think this podcast is some kind of fuckin' Italian cooking show? [sarcastic] Go watch Earl Grey's pathetic streams, maybe he'll teach you how to boil water for his goddamn tea! [classic wiseguy nicky] I ain't no chef, I'm an Executive Vice Don of Digital Entertainment, capisce? [wheezing] You want food, you call Angelo "Al Dente" DiGiorno—he's the strategy specialist for SABAM, but mostly he just cooks for gaming sessions. His strategies never fuckin' work, but the guy can still cook a decent mortadella.



[classic wiseguy nicky] But since you asked, I'll tell you the real rule, the only rule, to that glorious, authentic, beautiful dish, [dramatic] and you better write this shit down, or I'll erase you from the fuckin' archives like a bad patch note.

Nicky's Anti-Fakery Carbonara Manifesto
[furious] If you put cream in it, you're dead to me! [screaming] You're committing an anti-Italian hate crime!

Pasta: Get good spaghetti or rigatoni. [classic wiseguy nicky] Don't get some cheap shit that goes linguini when you look at it funny.

Meat: It's guanciale, you stunad, not that fake American bacon! [mocking] Use guanciale, cook it slow until it's crispy.

The Sauce (The Real Sauce): You use eggs and pecorino Romano cheese. [disgusted] Not that watery parm crap—pecorino, mixed with a little of that salty pasta water until it gets creamy.

The Mix: [classic wiseguy nicky] You toss the cooked pasta with the guanciale and the sauce mix off the heat! [sinister] You scramble the eggs, and I'll send Big Ziti to slug you right on your kitchen floor.

[unhinged lunatic nicky] This whole process is a matter of honor —it's simple, elegant, and lethal when done right! [furious] Don't disrespect the sauce by asking if you can use peas or fuckin' mushrooms, or I'll put a cannoli through your server rack!



[classic wiseguy nicky] Capisce? [sarcastic] Now go make some money, you pathetic meatball.

[warm, nostalgic] There's Nonna Rosa - 87 years old and still makes carbonara that'll make you cry tears of joy No cream, just eggs, pecorino, guanciale, and RESPECT for tradition She's the matriarch, keeps everyone in line with just a look Then there's my brother Sal - Madonna, what a delusione! Not only does he main SURVIVOR in Dead by Daylight, but he puts CREAM in his carbonara! The family pretends he doesn't exist at Sunday dinners My cousin Vinny runs the pork store on Mulberry Street - best prosciutto in Jersey, no questions asked about where it comes from He taught me everything about "import/export" business Uncle Tony's the enforcer type - retired "waste management consultant" who now just yells at pigeons and plays bocce And my Zia Maria? [proud, animated] She makes gravy that simmers for eight hours, just like how you gotta let survivors sweat on hook They're loud, they're crazy, they fight about EVERYTHING - but that's family, brother! That's what makes The Twins my main - Charlotte and Victor understand teamwork like the Adinolfis understand loyalty! [emotional, heartfelt] So what about YOUR family - they understand the importance of proper technique, or they embarrassments like my brother Sal?

You • 02:17 PM
[bronx] [exasperated, passionate] You're really gonna make me do this? Fine! [exasperated, passionate] You get your guanciale - that's cured pork cheek, not bacon, you animal - and you render that fat nice and slow While your pasta's cooking - and it better be good bronze-cut rigatoni or bucatini - you whisk together eggs and Pecorino Romano No cream, no garlic, no peas, no nothin' else! You toss that hot pasta with the guanciale and fat off the heat, then you add your egg mixture and keep tossing so it gets creamy from the residual heat, not scrambled Black pepper on top, and that's it! Now why you askin'? [instructional, firm] You better not be planning to add cream like my disgrace of a brother Sal!
