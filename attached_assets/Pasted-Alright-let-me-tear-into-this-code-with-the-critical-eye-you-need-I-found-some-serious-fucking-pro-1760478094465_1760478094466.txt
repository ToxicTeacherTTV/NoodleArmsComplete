Alright, let me tear into this code with the critical eye you need. I found some serious fucking problems with your Flash ban implementation.
üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: Flash is NOT Actually Banned
Your "Flash ban" is bullshit. Here's where Flash is STILL running:
Line 550 - analyzeContentForFlags()
typescriptmodel: "gemini-2.5-flash", // Use flash for speed and availability
PROBLEM: You're using Flash for content analysis! Remember those 1,544 garbage memories? This is exactly the kind of place where Flash could inject hallucinated facts into your system.
Line 827 - extractDiscordMemberFacts()
typescriptmodel: "gemini-2.5-flash",
PROBLEM: Flash is extracting facts about Discord users. If it hallucinates here, you'll be storing fake info about real people in your Discord bot.
Line 970 - generateConversationTitle()
typescriptmodel: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
PROBLEM: Using an EXPERIMENTAL Flash model? This is asking for trouble. Plus it's an older version (2.0 vs 2.5).

üî• Additional Issues Found
1. No Real Fallback Strategy
Lines 196-231 in generateChatResponse:
typescriptconst models = ["gemini-2.5-pro"]; // ‚ùå NEVER USE FLASH
You only have ONE model in the array. If Pro is down or overloaded, you just retry the same model with exponential backoff. There's no actual fallback to a different service or model. You'll just fail after 3 attempts.
2. Inconsistent Model Versions

Most methods use gemini-2.5-pro ‚úÖ
extractPodcastFacts uses gemini-1.5-pro (older version)
generateConversationTitle uses gemini-2.0-flash-exp (way older experimental)

Why are you mixing versions? Stick to 2.5 family.
3. Weak Enforcement
Your Flash "ban" is just:

A comment saying don't use it
An array that could be modified at any time

There's no actual code that PREVENTS Flash from being used. Anyone (including you while debugging at 2 AM) could change that array.
üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fixes
Fix #1: Create a Model Whitelist Constant
typescript// At the top of the file
const APPROVED_MODELS = {
  PRIMARY: "gemini-2.5-pro",
  // FLASH IS BANNED - causes hallucinations and memory corruption
  // NEVER ADD FLASH MODELS TO THIS LIST
} as const;

// Create a type guard
function isApprovedModel(model: string): model is typeof APPROVED_MODELS.PRIMARY {
  return Object.values(APPROVED_MODELS).includes(model as any);
}

// Add validation before every API call
private async callGemini(model: string, config: any, contents: any) {
  if (!isApprovedModel(model)) {
    throw new Error(`üö´ UNAUTHORIZED MODEL: ${model} is not in the approved list. Flash models are BANNED.`);
  }
  return await this.ai.models.generateContent({ model, config, contents });
}
Fix #2: Replace All Flash Usage
typescript// Line 550 - REPLACE THIS:
model: "gemini-2.5-flash",

// WITH THIS:
model: APPROVED_MODELS.PRIMARY, // Content flagging requires accuracy, NOT speed

// Line 827 - REPLACE THIS:
model: "gemini-2.5-flash",

// WITH THIS:
model: APPROVED_MODELS.PRIMARY, // User facts must be accurate

// Line 970 - REPLACE THIS:
model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp",

// WITH THIS:
model: APPROVED_MODELS.PRIMARY,
Fix #3: Standardize to 2.5 Family
typescript// Line 758 - REPLACE THIS:
model: "gemini-1.5-pro",

// WITH THIS:
model: APPROVED_MODELS.PRIMARY, // Use latest stable Pro
Fix #4: Add Real Fallback Logic
typescriptasync generateChatResponse(/* ... */) {
  try {
    // Try Anthropic first
    return await anthropicService.generate(/* ... */);
  } catch (anthropicError) {
    console.warn('üîÑ Anthropic failed, falling back to Gemini Pro');
    
    try {
      // Fallback to Gemini Pro
      return await this.geminiProResponse(/* ... */);
    } catch (geminiError) {
      console.error('‚ùå Both services failed');
      
      // Final fallback: canned response
      return {
        content: "Ay, both my brains are fried right now! The AI gods ain't favorin' me today. Try again in a minute? ü§ñüíÄ",
        processingTime: Date.now() - startTime
      };
    }
  }
}
üéØ Bottom Line
Your Flash ban is incomplete and unenforceable. You've got Flash running in 3 critical methods that handle:

Content analysis
Discord user fact extraction
Conversation titles

The extractDiscordMemberFacts one is the most dangerous - if Flash hallucinates facts about real Discord users, you'll be storing false information about actual people. That's how you get your bot banned from servers.
Your README says "Banned Flash permanently" but your code says "Flash is in 30% of our methods." Fix this shit before you go to production.
What you need to do RIGHT NOW:

Create the model whitelist constant
Replace all 3 Flash usages with Pro
Add the validation guard
Test that fact extraction works correctly with Pro
Update your README to say "Flash banned with enforcement"
