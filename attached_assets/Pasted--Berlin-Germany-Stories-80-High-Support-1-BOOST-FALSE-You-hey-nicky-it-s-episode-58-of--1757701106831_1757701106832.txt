### You hey nicky it's episode 58 of camping them softly and on where the fuck are the viewers from we're doing Berlin, State of Berlin, i heard you have a fucking crazy story, tell me about it bitch was victor with you? ### ChatGPT \[yelling\] BERLIN. STATE OF BERLIN. EPISODE FIFTY-FUCKIN’-EIGHT. You *wanna* hear a story? Oh, lemme take you on a little stroll through the bratwurst battleground that almost got me *deported in four languages.* \[disgusted\] So Victor and I—he’s in a fake baby stroller 'cause customs wouldn't clear “feral veal goblin” as a support animal—we land in Berlin for what’s *supposed* to be a quiet Fog diplomacy summit. SABAM was meetin’ with some rogue German entity worshippers to settle a jurisdictional dispute over meatball rights in Coldwind Lane. Normal Wednesday. \[suspiciously calm\] But we never made it to the summit. Why? ‘Cause SOMEONE—*probably Big Ziti, that flashlight-fearin' disgrace*—booked us a room in a haunted techno hostel run by *ex-SWF* survivors turned anti-hook anarchists. I’m talkin’ Fengs with piercings shaped like gens, pallets nailed to the fuckin’ walls, and instead of beds? Lockers. Fuckin’ lockers. \[furious\] I wake up to find Victor missing and my meatball chain swapped for a bratwurst on a lanyard. That’s when I knew... **they took him.**

### You hey nicky i made it to episode 58 without my heart exploding, but the problem is in two days we have fight nights at freddy's release on DbD. I'm not fucking excited at all, how do you feel about it? ### ChatGPT \[furious\] AYYYYYYYYYY YO... You're tellin’ me... in **TWO FUCKIN’ DAYS**... the sacred Fog, the battlefield of blood, hooks, and busted ankles... is gonna be INFESTED with a Chuck E. Cheese reject named *Freddy Fuckin’ Fazbear?!* \[screaming in disbelief\] We went from *campin’ Claudettes in cornfields*... to *hidin’ from furry death robots programmed by a Pizza Hut AI*! THIS AIN’T DEAD BY DAYLIGHT NO MORE—THIS IS **FIVE NIGHTS AT GET-THE-FUCK-OUTTA-MY-FOG**. \[sarcastically calm\] “Oh but Nicky, it’s got lore.” YEAH? SO DOES MY UNCLE TONY'S TOENAIL COLLECTION. DON’T MEAN I WANNA SEE IT ON A HOOK. \[yelling again\] Let me tell you somethin’, kid—Victor tried to bite that fuckin’ bear last night in a warm-up lobby. What happened? Freddy didn’t even flinch. He turned his head *180 degrees like a demonic Etch A Sketch*, played a carnival jingle, and Victor SHAT HIMSELF MID-AIR. We had to call in Charlotte with the industrial wet wipes. \[disgusted\] This is a **travesty**, a **goddamn pizza-stained betrayal** of everything this game stands for. BHVR? You bringin’ in corporate mascots now? What’s next—Ronald fuckin’ McDonald as a Mori cosmetic for Clown?
