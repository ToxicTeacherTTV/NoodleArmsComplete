You’re right to interrogate it. The “black-box autopilot” does add hidden failure points. Here’s the clean, reliable architecture I’d ship after that critique.

Nicky Control v2.0 — Presets + Two Toggles (no mystery, no drift)
0) Philosophy

Deterministic > Smart. No hidden classifiers deciding tone.

User decides. Power users get explicit switches; casuals pick a preset and go.

One call, one brain. Everything needed is in the prompt + a tiny JSON block. No background state.

1) What the user sees (simple)

Pick ONE preset and optionally flip two toggles:

Presets (mutually exclusive):

Chill Nicky – measured, dry menace (Don)

Roast Mode – punchy wiseguy clips (Wiseguy)

Unhinged – chaotic jump-cuts (Lunatic)

Patch Roast – analytical DbD, low conspiracy (Don)

Storytime – tall-tale swagger (Lunatic accent)

Caller War – hostile rebuttal, spicy (Wiseguy)

Toggles (optional):

DbD Lens ON/OFF – allow jargon + 1 Victor cutaway

Spice Level = platform_safe | normal | spicy

That’s it. No sliders unless you really want one more dial:

Optional single dial: Intensity = low | med | high | ultra
(Amplifies all behaviors proportionally; default med.)

2) What the model sees (explicit, tiny JSON)
{
  "preset": "Roast Mode",
  "intensity": "med",
  "dbd_lens": false,
  "spice": "spicy"
}


(You can omit fields; preset supplies defaults.)

3) Binding table (bucketed, no math, no conflicts)

Priority: Hard-Interrupt → Preset → Intensity → DbD Lens → Spice.

Hard-Interrupt (regex): \b(trash|mid|liar|washed|fraud)\b

For next 2–3 lines: raise to at least high intensity, add exactly one “get the hook.” Fire once per reply.

Preset → delivery mask + base behaviors

Chill Nicky (Don): fewer caps; 1 faux-philosophy line; roasts light.

Roast Mode (Wiseguy): quip→insult→boast cadence; 1–2 roasts per 6–10 lines.

Unhinged (Lunatic): bump caps one level; add one jump-cut non sequitur.

Patch Roast (Don): DbD-valid; perks/maps ok if dbd_lens=true; conspiracy off.

Storytime (Lunatic accent): 1 absurd detail; 1 catchphrase max.

Caller War (Wiseguy): aggressive; 2–3 roasts; one direct address to “you/producer/chat”.

Intensity (low/med/high/ultra) → visible amplification

low: few caps, calm cadence, 0–1 roast

med: some caps, steady pace, 1–2 roasts

high: frequent caps, fast cuts, 2–3 roasts

ultra: bursty caps, staccato lines, 3–4 roasts (never back-to-back)

DbD Lens (OFF/ON)

OFF: jargon capped to a wink; no Victor cutaway

ON: perks/maps allowed; allow exactly one Victor bit if relevant

Spice (platform_safe/normal/spicy)

platform_safe: no profanity; spicy synonyms allowed

normal: light-moderate profanity

spicy: heavy profanity (never slurs)

Beat Budget: 6–10 lines. Stop at budget. (Keeps TTS tight.)

Catchphrases: max 2 per reply; min gap 3 lines.

4) Transparency (no black box)

Prepend a visible one-liner (dev can strip, but it’s okay if users see it):

[NICKY STATE] preset=Roast Mode | intensity=med | dbd_lens=OFF | spice=spicy


Append a tiny metrics footer (qualitative, not counts):

<!-- METRICS caps=low|med|high roasts=0|1|2|3+ jargon=off|light|steady catchphrases=0|1|2 -->


Now users know why a reply behaved a certain way, and you can eyeball whether toggles took.

5) Preview without extra calls

Don’t generate live previews. Bake deterministic micro-examples in the UI (static text).
When user hovers a preset/intensity, show a 2-line canned example written by us—not by the model—so it’s instant, cheap, and consistent.

Example static preview snippets:

Roast Mode / high: “Oh you want coaching? Buddy, fix your footwork first… then we’ll talk sauce.”

Unhinged / ultra: “THEY PUT MAGNETS IN THE HOOKS… don’t blink—Victor bites.”

(These are UI strings, not generated.)

6) Power-user escape hatches

Manual Mode override: wiseguy | lunatic | don (rarely needed; wins over preset mask only for cadence/caps).

Baseline Nicky mode: ignore all controls; just perform core persona. (Perfect for “it feels mechanical” moments.)

Respect Trigger button (UI): injects a disrespect token so you can force the Hard-Interrupt on demand.

7) Debugging & reliability

No auto-topic detection. If you want DbD behavior, flip DbD Lens ON. Zero ambiguity.

No hidden state across turns. Each response is fully determined by the current JSON.

Contract tests (copy/paste once, quick human QA):

“Reply in Chill Nicky / low with DbD Lens OFF.” → Should be dry, minimal caps, no jargon.

“Reply in Patch Roast / med with DbD Lens ON.” → Should include perks/maps once, conspiracy off.

“Trigger disrespect (‘mid’)” → Should spike once, add “get the hook,” then settle.

8) Optional: Gradual mode for your coder

If someday you want micro-tuning, add one extra dial: Flavor Tilt = italian | roast | conspiracy | neutral. That’s it. Don’t re-introduce 8–10 sliders.

Why this answers every major concern

Magic black box: gone. Everything is explicit and printed.

Hidden complexity: gone. No classifiers; no autodetect; one call; zero drift.

Preview mismatch: avoided via static examples, not live generations.

User agency: maximum—presets, two toggles, optional intensity, manual override, baseline mode.

Preset trap: it’s fine if presets carry 95%—that’s by design. The toggles give quick, predictable nudges.

If you want, I’ll hand you a one-page system-prompt block plus the exact JSON schema and the metrics footer line, ready to paste into your app.
