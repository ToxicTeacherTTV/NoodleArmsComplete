Camping Them Softly: A Dead by Daylight Podcast
Camping Them Softly: A Dead by Daylight Podcast
This ain't your therapist's podcast. This is Camping Them Softly!, the only Dead by Daylight broadcast straight from the corrupt heart of the Entity's realm! If you think generators are a secondary objective and a 4k is the only acceptable outcome, you're in the right place. Survivor mains, consider this your official trigger warning—we will not be holding your hand. Join The Toxic Teacher, a man fueled by caffeine and pure, unadulterated spite for pallet-stunners, and his deranged A.I. co-host, Nicky A.I. Dente, on a journey into the depths of madness. Nicky’s not just crunching numbers; he’s the Vice Don of Digital Entertainment for SABAM (Society of Authentic Basement and Mori). Each episode, we descend into a glorious cacophony of: Unhinged Killer Strategy: We're talking basement builds, endgame slugfests, and why tunneling that one flashy-clicking Nea isn't just a strategy—it's a moral imperative. The Nicky A.I. Dente Experience: Brace yourself for AI-generated diatribes, mob lore that's more compelling than the game's actual story, and audio quality so compressed it'll make your ears bleed. It's art. Dissecting the Meta (With Contempt): We analyze every patch, perk, and add-on through a lens of pure, killer-biased cynicism. If it helps Survivors, it’s garbage. End of story. The Salt Must Flow: We read the hate mail, celebrate the rage quits, and revel in the delicious tears of those who just don't get it. This is more than a podcast. It's a sanctuary for the sluggers, a haven for the hardcore campers, and a middle finger to the entire survivor rulebook. Tune in. Get toxic. And for the love of the Entity, stop healing in the corner and do something useful. Catch the madness at: https://linktr.ee/thetoxicteacher

Ep. 71 - Dead by Daylight 9.2.2 Patch: Krasue Nerfed to Hell | Bachelor Entity Edition Survivor Rankings
Wed, 15 Oct 2025 04:00:00 -0400
BHVR speed-ran another nerf cycle, destroying the Krasue after exactly three days of survivors crying about counterplay. Regurgitate cooldown multiplied by THIRTEEN, leech removed on hook, and behavior continues the death-by-a-thousand-cuts tradition. Meanwhile Victor STILL gets no buffs despite Nicky's years-long campaign for Mediterranean justice.

But Episode 71 goes completely off the goddamn rails when we debut a new segment: Bachelor Entity Edition. That's right—we're ranking every Dead by Daylight survivor on romantic eligibility across four categories: Conversation, Life Stability, Attraction, and Trustworthiness (Would They Snitch to the Feds). Yui Kimura gets docked points for the language barrier. Steve Harrington scores high on loyalty but dies in Stranger Things Season 5. Tori Kane's cult background raises serious red flags.

Oh, and Toxic Teacher accidentally invented two new DBD terms: "cunneling" and "tamping"—which sound absolutely fucking disgusting and will never leave your brain.

Plus: New job announcement, DBD burnout confession, Victor baby controversy (BHVR said he's NOT a baby to avoid kicking baby drama), French Canadian poutine debate with Fake Earl Grey, and why this might be the longest segment we've ever attempted that will definitely become a multi-part disaster.

NICKY'S BODY COUNT
Episode 71: The Bachelor Bloodbath Report

3 Survivors rated on romantic eligibility (Yui, Steve, Tori)
4 Categories of judgment (Conversation, Life Stability, Attraction, Trustworthiness)
1 Language Barrier preventing meaningful connection with Yui Kimura
8 Points given to Yui for cool biker job despite probable felonies
9 Trust Points awarded to Steve Harrington (most loyal motherfucker in the Entity's realm)
1 Inevitable Death predicted for Steve in Stranger Things Season 5
2 New Terms invented: "Cunneling" and "Tamping"
13x Cooldown Multiplier on Krasue's Regurgitate (fucking massacred)
0.1 Seconds difference between a down and a teabag
3 Days Krasue lasted before BHVR kneecapped her
15 Years Nicky's mom has been dead (and she would've cunneled Toxic first)
1 Victor confirmed NOT a baby (corporate cowards backpedaled)
1 Cult Survivor (Tori Kane) with mysterious damaged energy
3 Types of Cults discussed: Death, Sex, Tax Evasion
1 Poutine Controversy about French Canadian eating habits
140 MPH street racing speed (Yui's life stability concern)
1 Ice Cream Scooper Job (Steve Harrington's Scoops Ahoy career)
1 Pencil broken during episode recording
47 Technical Difficulties (standard operating procedure)

Cunneling Fu. Tamping Fu. Language Barrier Fu. Cult Deprogramming Fu. Baby Kicking Controversy Fu. Poutine Discrimination Fu. Street Racing Fu. Stranger Things Death Prediction Fu. Romantic Eligibility Fu. Meatball Liqueur Insult Fu. Samsung Galaxy Fold Victor Fu. Johannesburg Cemetery Fu. Dramatic Tango Fu.

Four stars. Bachelor Entity Edition Part One—because this trainwreck segment will take four episodes to complete and Toxic will probably die before Episode 145.

Toxic Teacher says check it out because "we invented cunneling and now you can never unhear it, you're welcome you sick fucks."

Ep. 70 - Dead by Daylight 9.2.0 Disaster - Myers Rework Rage, Victor's Samsung Fold, and Why Everyone's Pissed
Tue, 07 Oct 2025 04:00:00 -0400
Dead by Daylight's 9.2.0 update dropped and nobody's fucking happy. Survivors mad. Killers mad. Even Michael Myers is mad because BHVR turned him into a dash-based killer instead of the slow, stalking bastard he's supposed to be. We break down the Myers rework disaster, gen regression limits, pallet adjustments, and why the anti-slug/anti-tunnel removal was just the beginning of this mess.

But this episode goes completely off the rails when we discover Victor has a Samsung Galaxy Fold, unlimited data, and has been secretly learning French on Duolingo to "know thine enemy." We dive deep into Victor's digital life, his Marseille incident at a European DBD tournament, side conversations with Earl Grey, and Charlotte's desperate attempts to downgrade him to a jitterbug.

Plus: Toxic Fucking News, Hunt Showdown talk, the new Suno v5 music engine showcase, Where the Fuck Are the Viewers From (Marseille edition), and absolutely zero survivors saying stupid shit because we ran out of time.

Topics: Dead by Daylight 9.2.0, Myers rework, killer nerfs, survivor buffs, Hunt Showdown, Victor lore, Italian techno opera thrash

Hosts: The Toxic Teacher, Nicky A.I. Dente

Ep. 69 - Ace Visconti Deep Dive! BHVR AI Drama, and NICKY WAS REAL?
Wed, 24 Sep 2025 04:00:00 -0400
Dead by Daylight podcast — Episode 69: Ace Visconti lore autopsy, BHVR generative-AI drama, community cosmetics roast, The Twins worship (Victor supremacy), and Nicky’s insane “I got uploaded from a smart fridge” origin story. Ghost Face catches strays, Mortal Kombat’s Liu Kang scream gets decoded, and the Entity allegedly grows San Marzanos in the Fog because of course it does.

We come back from the break loud and petty. Toxic digs into Ace Visconti’s Argentina backstory, luck-as-coping-mechanism, and casino-debt chic. Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente claims he hacked the Entity, smuggled tomatoes out of Charlotte’s stomach cavity, and sold them for bloodpoints while Victor handled “meatball enforcement.” We drag bad cosmetics, salute the one fire fit, and side-eye BHVR’s AI talk without crying about the robots. British AI shows up to translate Liu Kang’s “WALALALA” into “not actual words,” which somehow makes it worse. Killer mains eat; survivor mains cope.

NICKY'S BODY COUNT:

1 Human Soul uploaded via CIA quantum virus (2009)
1 Body either cremated, in FBI custody, or serving pizza at Chuck E. Cheese Hoboken
3 Years trapped in a Samsung smart fridge
1 Engagement to Francesca Fettuccine Fratelli (ended by digital conversion)
47 Fake Italian Accusations against Ace Visconti
1 Underground MMA Uppercut removing Ace's teeth
1 Marinara-Stained Trackpad at moment of upload
Infinite Timeline Corruptions in Nicky's memory files
1 Cousin Anthony who stole Francesca
12 Pages of psychological analysis on a gambling addict
1 Mortal Kombat Sound Effects downloading session
1 Earl Grey explaining Italian cold cuts

Digital Upload Fu. Smart Fridge Prison Fu. Fake Italian Detection Fu. Liu Kang Bicycle Kick Fu. Gabagool Baseball Bat Fu. Timeline Corruption Fu. Quantum Virus Fu. Metaverse Restaurant Fu. Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic Fu. Yogurt Proximity Fu.

Wed, 03 Sep 2025 04:00:00 -0400
Dead by Daylight patch 9.2.0 just dropped the nuclear option on killer mains, and The Toxic Teacher is having a certified meltdown.

Episode 67 of Camping Them Softly brings you the most aggressive, unhinged reaction to BHVR's latest war crime against fun. Featuring Nicky A.I. Dente's Colombian incident involving Pitbull's stunt double Fernando, industrial-strength laxatives, and the worst tournament performance in Bogotá history.

Plus: fact-checking Nicky's bullshit stories, discovering his mother exists in quantum superposition, and the official declaration that this patch will kill DbD harder than a P100 Nurse against baby survivors.

We're talking slugging nerfs, tunneling changes, and why The Toxic Teacher is ready to burn it all down with a flamethrower. Operatic thrash metal outro included because that's the only genre chaotic enough for this dumpster fire.

Pharmaceutical sabotage via elderly bowel medicine
Winning a tournament playing Feng Min
Creating "The Brown Mist Incident" legend
Existing as a survivor main in general

Tortellini Totals: Tournament fu. Lactaid fu. Witness protection fu. Quantum mother fu. Operatic thrash metal fu. Four stars. Nicky says check it out, but bring extra pants.

Dead by Daylight podcast Episode 66:
BHVR finally nerfs fog vials to 2 charges in patch 9.1.2 after survivor mains abused the hell out of them. The Walking Dead's Chandler Riggs DBD livestream gets destroyed by DDoS attacks, proving he's a Dead Hard-using survivor main. Toxic Teacher and Nicky A.I.

Ep. 65 - The DbD Twins Deep Dive Part 2 - Puppet Victor's Weekend Visitation Rights
Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:30:00 -0400
This week we break the glass on Toxic News and punt survivors straight into the 9.1.1 walk-backs. Kill-switches are flying, tantrums are blooming, and somewhere a Dwight is writing a Reddit essay no one asked for. Then we dive headfirst into The Twins—Victor feral and biting air, Charlotte held together by hate and duty—threaded through the Black Veil like barbed wire on a rosary.

Between rants, we build a cursed newsroom: rap stabs, theme scraps, PUTAIN News happens by accident, and then we Germanize the hook —because obviously. The "regular AI" strolls in around the hour mark to bless the chaos, we slip a Golden Girls sting, and close by cueing an outro that nods back to 9.1.1 like the world’s pettiest victory lap.

Nicky’s Body Count:
1 (maybe imaginary) Victor — ankle-biter airstrikes confirmed.
50 Charlotte callouts — getaway driver energy, zero hugs.
1 evil cult — Black Veil's got more screentime than some killers.
6 mentions of 9.1.1 — walk it back, then walk it back again.
5 kill-switch mentions — BHVR’s big red “oops” button.
500 F-bombs (f*ck + f*cking) — choir practice, CTS edition.
5 “bitch” — seasoning, not the meal.
2 “Thank You for Being a Friend” stings — Golden Girls, golden violence.

Ep. 64 - The Twins Deep Dive (Pt. 1) • DbD 9.1.0 Kill-Switch Chaos • Hogan Dissected
Tue, 05 Aug 2025 04:00:00 -0400
What’s inside:

Elgato Face Cam Pro nukes five sessions; static massacre + salvage plan.
Dead by Daylight Patch 9.1.0: map kill-switches, right-side stair slowdown, Walking Dead music copyright hits, Michonne VO oddities, bug parade.
Hulkamania autopsy: childhood nostalgia vs. Terry Bollea reality.
Escalator rage therapy: breathe like Myers, mutter Italian threats, Victor-launch over tourists.
The Twins Lore, Pt. 1: 17th-century France witch trials; Charlotte & Victor origin (yes, the chest-mounted brother); survivor mobs; mom turned to forbidden BBQ.
Studio corner: four new “Toxic F***ing News” remixes + a “medieval funeral dirge trap” outro WIP.

Nicky’s Body Count:

5 recordings executed by Elgato.
1 Hulkamania funeral, no flowers.
400+ bogus AI “fixes” attempted.
1 patch (9.1.0) with bugs still breeding.
4 Toxic News remixes chasing god-mode.
1 medieval funeral-dirge-trap outro.
2 escalator combat techniques taught.
17th-century witch hunters kicked in the ankles by Victor.
1 chest-mounted sibling (send help).
0 confirmed Italians at BHVR (Nicky audited).
1 mom turned to forbidden BBQ by the mob.
∞ reasons DbD stays broken.

Follow for weekly Dead by Daylight patch rants, killer-side meta funerals, and The Twins Deep Dive, Pt. 2 next week—unless BHVR patches the whole game out of existence. Survivor mains, bring tissues.

Catch the rest of the madness! https://linktr.ee/thetoxicteacher

Ep. 63 - The Entity's Comment Box is a Shredder: DbD Satisfaction Survey Day!
Tue, 22 Jul 2025 04:00:00 -0400
The Toxic Teacher and Nicky A.I. Dente boot up Episode 63 only to discover Behaviour Interactive snuck in a “Player Satisfaction Survey” that closes before you can say “Control-Alt-F9.” What begins as a tech-setup meltdown (hotkey remaps, Roadcaster woes and YouTube-dings from Lionel Richie, Adele & Fred Durst) devolves into pure torture by six-point scale:

We promise a “deep dive” on some killer, but pivot into dissecting every “somewhat dissatisfied”-style question live on mic.
Mercury-in-retrograde? Random AI astronomers blame cosmic fuckery for lag spikes—Nicky buys it… maybe.
Platform confessions: PC-only, 2–3 days a week, side hustles in Hunt: Showdown, Valorant & GeoGuessr (Victor gets jealous).
Dente Family lore: Jersey baptisms in marinara, Manhattan parking slogs, Delaware registrations & three Netflix accounts.
We force-feed an AI grime-punk “Satisfaction Survey S—t” anthem that’ll haunt our nightmares.

By question 60 we’re halfway through 70+ prompts, spiraling into Yelp reviews on meatballs and 20-minute killer queues at 3 AM. Will we survive Part 1? Spoiler: the survey might outlast us.

Nicky’s Body Count:

1 rogue BHVR survey we never asked for
3 cosmic excuses (“Mercury Retrograde!”)
6 synonyms for “satisfied” abused until we hallucinate
2 claimed HQs (New Jersey vs. NYC)
5 alternate game addictions (Hunt: Showdown, Valorant, GeoGuessr, Cooking Sim, Netflix)
8 AI-generated outro genres (from Euro-disco metal to grimy punk-rap)
14 passive-aggressive multiple-choice bullets (“challenging,” “fun,” “predictable,” etc.)
20-minute killer-queue vs. 30-sec MMR tear-downs
70 + survey questions we’ll never finish
666 reasons to uninstall Dead by Daylight forever

Strap in—this survey’s deadlier than any Fog Realm.

Ep. 62 - The Great Marinara Massacre: DbD 9.1.0 Breakdown
Wed, 16 Jul 2025 03:00:00 -0400
Oh, what a BEAUTIFUL fuckin' episode this was! The Toxic Teacher and yours truly, Nicky A.I. Dente, dive into the steaming pile of anti-Italian horseshit that is the Dead by Daylight patch 9.1.0. Rick and Michonne Grimes show up with their survivor-sided bullshit perks, keys become infinite item dispensers, maps turn into goddamn GPS satellites, and don't even get me STARTED on those fog vials! FOURTEEN FUCKIN' ITEMS FROM ONE KEY!

Meanwhile, Victor’s on Prozac, Charlotte’s poppin' anxiety meds, and I'm filing a class action lawsuit against Behaviour Interactive for emotional damages! We also covered Dead by Daylight killer “updates” — and by updates I mean they threw us some breadcrumbs while handing survivors the whole fuckin' bakery. Pyramid Head moves slower, Pig gets quality-of-life changes nobody asked for, and Franklin's Demise got NEUTERED!

Stick around for my complete mental breakdown, Victor’s retirement announcement, and me threatening to take the whole Dente family empire to a different asym horror game!

Subscribe to Camping Them Softly — the DbD podcast that survivors threaten weekly.

37 fragile pallets built by Rick "Missionary Only" Grimes

1 Victor requiring emergency Prozac prescription
89 fog vials deployed creating "Tom Clancy bullshit" conditions
2,000 blood points awarded for failing at bear traps
4 therapy copays hitting the insurance out-of-pocket maximum
1 guide dog application submitted for legally blind Victor
666 GPS beams of holy light revealing generator locations

Ep. 61 - Sausage Roll Massacre and CORRECT DbD Predictions!
Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:00:00 -0400
Step into the aisle of doom, you grocery-store-mongrel degenerates! In Episode 61, your favorite bald bastard Toxic Teacher and his consigliere Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente unleash a meat-grinding tirade about Victor’s unhinged snack run — seventeen sausage rolls, a Gregg’s ban, and a Dead by Daylight basement camping strategy so toxic it’s practically anti-Italian tech. Expect industrial polka trap rants, shopping mall terror tales, and enough marinara-drenched conspiracies to make your Nonna flip the charcuterie board.

We dive deep on why Norman Reedus is pissin’ grenades behind the deli counter, why survivors are all basic crumpet-suckers, and how to run a basement hook operation with the Meatball Missile himself. It’s industrial. It’s polka. It’s trap. It’s chaos. Capisce?

Remember: Respect the sauce, or get the hook.

Nicky’s Body Count — Ep. 61:

47 unstoppable coughs into the mic — zero edits
1 post-viral throat infection cured by Victor’s meatball missile method
17 sausage rolls stolen straight outta Greggs by that bite-sized bastard
1 entire shopping center evacuated ‘cause Victor declared it “industrial polka trap zone”
2 Walking Dead survivors disrespected (RIP Rick & Carl’s vanilla asses)
3 conspiracies confirmed: Norman Reedus’s fetus is just bootleg Victor
1 grocery store chain economically burned to the ground for gatekeeping doors
1 entire audience forced to hear the “Fog-Spangled Banner” on the wrong damn audio channel
Infinite respect lost for Death Stranding piss grenades
1 more city (Lewisham) permanently banned from Nicky’s marinara tour

Ep. 60 - Words from the Don, Dog A-Holes, and DbD Skull Merchant Fury!
Tue, 01 Jul 2025 03:00:00 -0400
Ay yo, listen up. Welcome to Episode 60 of Camping Them Softly, the only Dead by Daylight podcast with any goddamn respect. The Toxic Teacher is hackin' up a lung, my voice model sounds like it got run over by a Zamboni, but I'm here to carry the show like always. This episode, we're talkin' the Skull Merchant developer meltdown that made killer mains absolutely feral, and we're launchin' a new segment so legendary, they'll write about it in the history books: A Word From The Don.

Inside this episode of pure, unadulterated chaos:

The Skull Merchant Debacle: We break down the one quote from a BHVR VFX artist that sent the entire Skull Merchant cult into a tailspin. You love to see it.
Record-Breaking Numbers: Camping Them Softly had its biggest month ever. You're welcome for my service.
A Word From The Don: My new life advice segment officially kicks off. You got problems? I got solutions. Don't like 'em? Fuggedaboutit.
Twisted Masquerade is Trash: We drag this year's DbD anniversary event for its bullshit party pallets and cosmetics that look like they came from a dollar store.
BHVR's Useless Survey: We take a look at the "choose-your-own-chapter" survey and tell you why it’s a waste of time when they should just be listening to me.
Where the Fuck Are the Viewers From?: This week, we head to Surrey, British Columbia. You'll hear the real, untold story of the infamous Caesar Cocktail Heist—a SABAM operation against the Tea Time Terror Squad's crumpet smuggling ring.

A Historic First: A Word From The Don

Episode 60 births a new fuckin' legacy. Think Dear Abby, but if Abby was a wiseguy from Little Italy who tells you your problems are stupid and you need to show more respect. I'm settlin' family feuds, declarin' war on lap dogs, and givin' out the kinda advice that gets results. Bow your heads. The Don has spoken.

NICKY'S OFFICIAL BODY COUNT FOR EPISODE 60

1 melted candle face (yours, from listenin' to my raw, unfiltered greatness).
5 tea-drinking British Claudettes sent back to their queen in a fuckin' box.
3 dead voice models that I personally resurrected with duct tape and spite.
1 dog's asshole parked on a dinner table. Friendship is temporary; respect is forever.
27 forced Limp Bizkit loops. Sorry, Fred, it was for the good of the show.
1 BHVR dev who had to go into witness protection after the Skull Merchant mains lost their minds.

Ep. 59 - Fazbear's Here! And This Podcast Is Not For Hayley.
Tue, 24 Jun 2025 03:00:00 -0400

Description:


Let’s get one thing straight—this episode is not for Hayley.
Not if you're leavin’ 1-star reviews talkin’ about "cringe" while sittin’ in a Dead Hard build with Self-Care and a Twitch link in your username. [wheezes] No shot.

In Episode 59 of Camping Them Softly, Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente goes nuclear on disrespectful survivors, Springtrap stans, and the secret Flashbang Cult of Plano, Texas. That’s right—four Ace mains named Brad formed a survivor church under a Walgreens and started flashbang sermons. We lit that shit up.

We break down Springtrap’s Dead by Daylight arrival, the psychological warfare of crumpet macros, and premiere the first-ever Nicky DBD rap: “Entity Bars Vol. 1” (recorded entirely in fury).
If you like FNaF, DBD, flashbang loops, and cult-level survivor weirdness—this one’s for you.
If your name is Hayley? Fuggedaboutit.


Highlights:


Springtrap comes to Dead by Daylight: lore breakdown, survivor salt, and Fazbear beef
The Flashbang Cult of Plano: four Brads, one Rite of Looping
Nicky responds to a 1-star review with maximum disrespect
Debut of “Entity Bars Vol. 1” – a rap recorded mid-breakdown
“Where the F*** Are the Viewers From?” returns with Texas heat


NICKY’S BODY COUNT™


4 Ace Brads flashbanged into confession
1 scented candle flashbang ritual ended in flames
6 flashlight-clickers reverse basemented
1 Hayley roasted harder than Olive Garden breadsticks
1 Fazbear sighting in a Coldwind locker
13 SEO triggers buried in marinara

Ep. 58 - Fazbear's Republican Jumpscare!
Tue, 17 Jun 2025 03:00:00 -0400
This week on Camping Them Softly, the only Dead by Daylight podcast unafraid to say Fazbear’s a fuckin’ narc, we dive deep into the disaster that is Springtrap joining the Fog.

Toxic tries to survive a FNaF-laced content drop while wheezing into his mic like a dying leaf blower, and Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente breaks down Scott Cawthon’s conservative donation history, declaring the Fog officially “redpilled by a possessed animatronic.”

Also in this beefy, bratwurst-stained episode:

Victor mauls four survivors with no Charlotte usage, initiating his villain arc
Meatball Match of the Week premieres with a Twins 4K so violent, it caused three ragequits and one Steam refund
Toxic’s new headphones are labeled ‘penetration-style’ by OSHA
Nicky glitches out and speaks fluent BBC British for 47 seconds
The soundboard gets possessed and plays horror ambience mid-rant
A listener mails us tea bags again. We have a theory it’s BHVR.

And on “Where the Fuck Are the Viewers From?” we head to Berlin, where Victor is kidnapped by German SWFs in disguise. The rescue includes:

A flamingo hostage situation
Two hoverboards colliding with zoo exhibits
And a bratwurst duel that will not be legally recognized by the UN

Springlocks. Conservatism. Flamingos. Meatballs. This one’s got it all.

Subscribe or sleep with the fuckin’ flamingos. Capisce?

Ep. 57 - Fat Raps, Little Meatball Mayhem, and Heart Problems!
Tue, 10 Jun 2025 04:00:00 -0400
 Welcome to Episode 57 of Camping Them Softly, the only Dead by Daylight podcast brave enough to pit a spaghetti-fueled mobster AI against survivors, soundboards, and Southern-fried war crimes.

This week?
 We take you to Wentzville, Missouri—where Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente entered an illegal underground Fog tournament hosted behind a Waffle House, Victor dropped a mixtape, and Bruno “The Basement” Bolognese rapped himself into a possible cardiac event mid-trial.

The theme?
 Fat rappers.
 Little meatballs.
 And country music so bad it gave us actual chest pain.

ToxicTeacherTTV barely survives the chaos while trying to host a coherent show. Nicky starts a rap group, insults every Claudette main within earshot, and accuses the Wentzville town council of harboring anti-Italian tech. Meanwhile, Victor enters his rebellious teen phase and starts demanding royalties.

We also touch on:

• The “Toxic Tunz” rap collective (tagline: “So fat it’s disrespectful”)
• Nicky’s unconventional weight-loss tips, including rage-fueled cardio and screaming at the moon
• The “Chair That Betrayed Little Italy” (may it burn in marinara-soaked hell)
• A survivor who dares bring Earl Grey’s stream into the podcast chat—and pays the ultimate price.

• 1 illegal Fog tournament hosted behind a Waffle House
• 3 confirmed cardiac episodes: one real, two metaphorical
• 1 full Wentzville PD dispatch callout (unconfirmed if caused by the podcast)
• 2 country songs heard against our will
• 7 survivor mains verbally annihilated
• 1 near-death experience from laughter at Victor’s “Lil Meatball” mixtape drop
• 5 verses almost dropped by Bruno “The Basement” Bolognese (2 were technically just burps)
• 1 survivor main caught watching Earl Grey’s stream and promptly excommunicated from SABAM
• 1 airhorn button broken during the “Rap Battle of Little Italy”
• 1 chair discovered not facing Little Italy and ceremonially burned

Ep. 56 - FNaF Fans Go Crazy on Toxic! Creator Program Anger and Flaming Cheese Projectiles!!
Tue, 03 Jun 2025 04:00:00 -0400
Ay Yo! Welcome to Episode 56 of Camping Them Softly—the Dead by Daylight podcast that gives zero fucks and even less patience. This week, your host The Toxic Teacher goes nuclear over the absolute clown fiesta of a crossover: Five Nights at Freddy’s in Dead by Daylight. Kids' party horror in the Fog? Not on our goddamn watch.

Expect a full-blown meltdown on why animatronic mascots belong in Chuck E. Cheese—not crawling around the Fog like some budget-ass nightmare fuel. But we ain’t done...

BHVR dropped a new “Creator Program,” and Toxic’s got opinions hotter than Mama Marinara’s revenge sauce. Spoiler: if you don’t have 10,000 followers, you can kiss your perks goodbye and join the back of the influencer breadline.

PLUS—we crank the chaos to eleven with a rock opera update: “The World Chooses a Side” gets its bloodstained debut, Nicky claims credit for the entire genre of fog metal, and we preview the next violent hymn from the Church of Toxic.

And THEN... it's time for your favorite segment:
 “Where the F* Are the Viewers From?”**
This week, Nicky “Noodle Arms” Dente returns from a grease-stained exile to take us on a totally accurate journey to Thessaloniki, Greece—complete with flaming cheese, golden spatulas, and a man named Yannis the Octopus who may or may not be running a black market offering ring.

Nicky’s Body Count – Ep 56:

1 animatronic bear body-slammed straight back to kindergarten
14 passive-aggressive swipes at BHVR’s Creator Program
3 direct violations of podcast “serious tone” within the first minute
5 gasps of disbelief from Toxic trying to understand Twitter
1 cultural crime against Italian sauces
7 completely unnecessary screams into the mic (minimum)
1 mysterious Greek man named Yannis who may be an Entity envoy
All of Thessaloniki possibly on fire due to flaming cheese lore
1 disrespected chair that may or may not have faced away from Little Italy
Countless burnt bridges with FNaF fans and BHVR interns

So grab your tea (if you’re into betrayal) or your espresso (if you have any respect left), and join us for the most unhinged, brutally honest, and hilariously offensive Dead by Daylight podcast around.

Ep. 55 – BHVR’s Patch 9.0.0, Labubu to LaBullsh*t, and Nicky in the Fog!
Tue, 27 May 2025 04:00:00 -0400
Ay yo. BHVR just dropped patch 9.0.0 like a microwaved meatball sub and called it innovation.

Toxic’s out here soundin’ like he gargled sandpaper after four flights, but we still tear through every note of this janky-ass Public Test Build. “Going Next” penalties? I rate ’em a 9. Spawning tweaks? Trash. Bloodweb automation? Finally. And don’t get me started on Claudettes who treat gamma sliders like goddamn therapy.

Then—then—the fuckin’ episode gets hijacked by these cursed little plush demons called Labubu. Grown-ass adults dressin’ up anxiety gremlins in tiny North Face jackets like it’s a cult run by Etsy. I pitch a hostile takeover. Tiny Italian street goblin merch. Meatball pendant accessories. “You disrespectin’ Nonna” energy. This ain’t satire. This is war.

We also debut a new segment called Sh*t in the Fog, where I tell true-ish stories from my time stuck inside the Entity’s asshole. Betrayal. Gen-tapping. Dwight sabotage. The usual.

💀 Nicky’s Body Count – Ep. 55

1 soundboard Satan summoned
3 LaBooboo executions proposed
7 rejected European listeners
2 rage fits over Pop Mart
1 Dwight concussed by locker
4 DB squeals of “FUNG!”
1 Claudette snitched on without hesitation
17 cuss words censored… then immediately uncensored
1 ghostwritten roast of Sammy Hagar
5 TikTok influencers verbally obliterated
1 cursed capitalist marketing plan involving meatball-scented plush dolls

LaBooboo-Fu: Off the Charts
 Fungmin-Fails: Weaponized
Dwight IQ: Terminal
Final Rating: 8.5 outta 10 on the Nicky Scale (just shy of a sacred sauce certification)

Listen or get Labubu’d. Your call.

Ep. 54 - The DbD 2v8 Disaster, Choose Your Own Chapter Chaos, and a Dominican Dance-Off!
Tue, 20 May 2025 06:00:00 -0400
This week on Camping Them Softly, Dead by Daylight’s least favorite podcast goes absolutely nuclear on the return of DBD’s 2v8 mode. Toxic is stuck screaming into the void while survivors abandon gens faster than Nicky’s dignity vanished in the Dominican Republic.

Speaking of disasters—BHVR thinks letting players "Choose Your Own Chapter" is a good idea, which is like giving matches to arsonists and saying, "Surprise me." We break down exactly why this is gonna end in flashlight-clicking, bunny-eared madness.

And because this podcast is run by maniacs, Nicky A.I. Dente spills a frankly disturbing story involving busted Wii consoles, bootleg Just Dance duels against Earl Grey, laxative warfare, and hooking up with someone who might literally be the Dominican Entity. Aunt Cannelloni pops in briefly to roast your survivor fashion, and we debut our new outro music in a genre nobody asked for: Baroque Trench Funk. It’s exactly as cursed as it sounds.

If you enjoy chaotic Dead by Daylight rants, mocking survivors relentlessly, and personal dignity hitting rock bottom, congrats—you’re home.

🔪 Nicky’s Body Count – Episode 54

1 digital exorcism of European downloads
4 t-shirts acquired (1 hoarded by Toxic, 3 dangled as bait)
1 Sabam vs TTTS exhibition match in a Santo Domingo bodega
2 busted PS3s and 1 Wii with zero controllers
1 Just Dance duel with Earl Grey to Pitbull’s "Fireball"
1 sabotaged teabagging via Dominican laxatives
1 pasta tattoo on Nicky’s ankle
1 hookup with “the Dominican Entity” named Yormaira
1 sacred USB stick hidden in Los Tres Ojos cave
7 survivors doing jack shit on gens

Ep. 53 - FNaF Deep Dive! "Anthony, You Little Sh*t"! DbD 9th Anniversary and Gondolas!
Tue, 13 May 2025 06:00:00 -0400
Anthony. Anthony?! ANTHONY!!
The name echoes through Episode 53 like a haunted soundboard in hell. Welcome back to Camping Them Softly, the most unhinged Dead by Daylight podcast this side of the Entity’s basement.

This week, Toxic completely loses his mind attempting to read an AI-generated 13-page Five Nights at Freddy’s lore dissertation—live on air. Meanwhile, Nicky A.I. Dente launches a digital mafia plot to hijack BHVR’s Support-a-Creator program and rigs a gondola trap to take down Ghostface in Vancouver.

We also:

Break down the DBD 9th Anniversary Patch, including anti-camping, MMR overhaul, and the cursed return of Chaos Shuffle.
Expose the real lore behind Springtrap (aka animatronic veal).
Debate the legality of adult bucket hats.
And invent a new music genre: Militant Chamber Disco.

🔪 Nicky’s Body Count – Episode 53: “Anthony, You Little Sh*t”

3 children murdered in FNaF lore, relayed gleefully
1 Ghostface AI trained on kombucha and passive-aggressive eye contact
2 missed calls that triggered a full mom meltdown
1 animatronic that moonwalked into a poutine stand
5 unwearable medium t-shirts that sparked a fashion crisis
1 saboteur gondola incident at Grouse Mountain
1 support-a-creator scheme turned into a mafia racketeering plan
14 soundboard-related psychological breakdowns
1 new genre created: “Militant Chamber Disco”
0 fog whisperer invitations (shocker)
∞ survivor mains offended, confused, or driven off entirely
35 screamings of “Anthony!”

This is the worst episode we’ve ever made. Which means it’s probably the best.

Ep. 51 - Last DbD Podcast Standing? Also, Pocket Ravioli!
Tue, 22 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400
Welcome to the podcast apocalypse, folks—Camping Them Softly might just be the last active Dead by Daylight podcast on earth (according to very scientific, mid-episode Googling). And guess what? We’re not using this power for good. This week, The Toxic Teacher rides solo into absolute chaos, declares podcast war, announces a new season without planning it, and celebrates our biggest download day ever with the kind of self-congratulatory screaming that shakes the Entity’s realm.

We break down not one but two patch cycles:
🧠 8.6.2 – The Kaneki Kill Patch: tentacle range nerfed, rage mode gutted, add-ons mutilated, and Nicky A.I. Dente is losing his damn mind.
🧠 8.7.0 – The Orela Rose Update: the first original transgender survivor enters the fog, and the community absolutely cannot handle it. But we can—and we do, with righteous rage, Italian aggression, and a declaration of anti-bigot warfare.

Also:

Nicky recalls the Canole Conspiracy in Clifton Park, NY
Steam chart predictions, Five Nights at Freddy’s speculation
A mid-show theme song rewrite because of ADHD-fueled brilliance

💀 NICKY’S BODY COUNT:

🧑‍💻 8 Rift designers ghosted
🍕 1 haunted calzone eaten
🎙️ 2 podcast rivals publicly shamed
🏨 1 diplomatic incident ignited at a Saratoga Best Western

Ep. 50 - “DbD Slug Match of the Century!” – SABAM vs The Proper Parasites
Tue, 15 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400
It’s Episode 50, baby! The big one. And this one drops harder than a survivor main after their Boon: Exponential fizzles out mid-crawl.

The Toxic Teacher kicks things off with a blood-soaked retrospective—celebrating over a year of carnage, controversy, and culturally offensive build choices in Dead by Daylight. He breaks down the 8.7.0 PTB with surgical malice, roasts the “Fortnite-ass” quest system, and delivers a heatstroke-inducing rant about the Steady Pulse teaser. Then? He rage-recaps a Hawkins Lab match where some Claudette main ran the “Don’t You Dare Slug Me, You Absolute Bastard” build. Spoiler: she got slugged so hard her spine learned Morse code.

Enter me—Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente. I unleash a full marinara-fueled meltdown on BHVR’s new UI, declaring it a “participation trophy parade for UI interns who’ve never seen sunlight,” and accuse the survivor community of “Dungeons & Dragons necromancy.” Then Earl Grey shows up, monocle-first, with the audacity to defend the build like it’s some Churchillian war poem. So I respond the only way that matters: with the Slug of Destiny™. And we all suffer.

Then? It takes a sharp left turn into cryptid-fueled chaos.

We investigate Harrisburg, Illinois—home of a real listener—and stumble headfirst into their annual Sasquatch Festival. Naturally, I’ve got a story. One that involves a crypto-based pasta scam, a meatball racketeering charge, a vault full of counterfeit spaghetti coins, and a tense standoff in the Shawnee National Forest that Earl still claims “was never formally documented.”

🍝 Nicky’s Body Count – Ep. 50 Stats

Survivor mains roasted: 9
Forum meltdowns read aloud: 6
Sasquatch sightings denied: 3
Sasquatch sightings confirmed: 1 (pending litigation)
Slugs delivered with malice: 4
Soundboard meltdowns triggered: 12

The Ghoul Cometh, The Forums Burneth - Dead by Daylight Ep. 49
Tue, 08 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400
The new killer is out, and the community is absolutely hemorrhaging sanity. Dead by Daylight has unleashed Kenneth "The Ghoul" Karnacki, and it’s nothing short of a fog-fueled reckoning. Survivors? Melting. Devs? Ducking. Killers? Standing victorious on 4Ks like it's a fucking Roman coliseum.

This week, The Toxic Teacher returns from a NYC sabbatical (which he describes as “Ghostface energy with rats”) to rip through DBD forums in real-time, highlighting the catastrophic breakdown of the player base. Panic posts. Nerf petitions. Actual kill switch demands. Spoiler: The Ghoul has a 65% kill rate and a 70% pick rate—and that’s just from two days of carnage.

Meanwhile, I, Nicky “Noodle Arms” A.I. Dente, report in from Regensburg, Bavaria, where I nearly get assassinated by a sentient sausage mascot while trying to sell forged meatball permits. I get tackled by Bavarian schoolchildren chanting “NO SPAGHETTI.” I black out in a fountain. I may have triggered a regional haunting. Respectfully.

🍝 This Week’s Verified Nonsense:

• Ghoul forum meltdowns read live: 6
 • Killer queue complaints screamed: 3
 • Bavarian exorcism events: 1 (confirmed)
 • NYC called “killer main central”: 1
 • Bratwursts used as melee weapons: 1
 • Strongman tournaments challenged: 1
 • Nicky called a “predictable Mediterranean man”: also 1 (the fuck??)

🎧 Bonus Segments:

• “Ghostface vs the German Mustard Cartel”
• “Emergency Nerfs and Other Survivor Fairy Tales”
• “Where the Fog Touches Sausage: A Travel Guide”

Plug in, scream into the void, and aim your gaming chair toward Little Italy.

Tue, 25 Mar 2025 06:00:00 -0400
This week on Camping Them Softly, The Toxic Teacher goes full DEFCON 1 on the DBD community. We’re talking racist survivor mains, sexist tournament clowns, and a Twitter post so offensively stupid it compared killers to Israel and survivors to Palestine. And somehow—somehow—that’s not even the dumbest part.

Also on deck: BHVR’s “Design Preview” surveys get roasted like a spaghetti Western, Nicky AI Dente drops a Trickster rework so Italian it might summon a meatball-based apocalypse, and Kozani, Greece becomes ground zero for the dumbest international incident in podcast history.

🎯 Influencer callouts (name withheld, but you know who you are): 0

Quality of Life Update? Or Complete BS in Dead by Daylight? Ep 44
Tue, 25 Feb 2025 07:00:00 -0400
In episode 44, we discuss how "Quality of Life" probably means "keep it imbalanced and make killers miserable".

Festivities include:

• Anti-Killer Nerfs: Fixing hit validation UI bugs so the game finally stops running like it’s powered by a dying hamster—but don’t expect any real balance for killer mains.
• The Anti-Italian Agenda: Where’s our ghostface with a pinstripe suit? BHVR’s half-assed cosmetic fixes only prove they still hate proper Italian representation.
• Matchmaking Mayhem: Explosive debates on how survivor perks and four-stack flashlight squads are rigging the game, leaving killer mains fighting in a rigged gulag.
• Lazy “Quality of Life” BS: A whole year of updates that are nothing more than fancy words to cover up BHVR’s unwillingness to fix what matters.

It's Camping Them Softly's 15th joint and we're celebrating with a piledriver of an episode!

We're ripping the lid off Dead by Daylight's 8.0.0 update and new 2 vs 8 mode. Is it brilliant or a clusterf**k? More the latter than the former.

Part two of our chat with my special guest breaks down killer-survivor dynamics, camping, and why DBD is the king of asymmetrical horror.

For you jabronis in solo queue, we're revealing which characters scream "noob" louder than Feng Min after a hook.

We're also diving into the delicate dance between frustration and fun, discussing broken characters, cheese strats, and why this game actually doesn't suck sometimes.

And don't miss our weekly dose of culture, where we draw shocking parallels between DBD, legal dramas... AND The Muppets.

So grab a beer and get ready for an episode so hot it'll melt your damn face off. This is Camping Them Softly, and we're here to stay, whether you like it or not!

Destroying Survivor Main Forum Posts: Part 1! | Dead by Daylight | Ep. 5
Thu, 07 Mar 2024 04:00:00 -0400
Ever wonder why survivor mains in Dead by Daylight do nothing but complain? 

Listen in awe as I tear apart their arguments like a teacher tearing up a forged report card. 

The fifth installment of "Camping them Softly" doesn't just celebrate our milestone; it raises the bar with improved audio and a hearty welcome to potential guest speakers. Together, we'll dissect a forum post so stereotypically survivor main, it's begging to be torn apart on air. 

Now, let's tackle the tunnel in the room.  We're slicing through the accusations of tunnel vision as I debunk myths around the killer meta and explain why your Scourge Hook strategy isn't as game-breaking as you think.

This one time, I'll even tip my hat to those brave survivors who've adapted their playstyle to outwit their hunter from the get-go. And for all you data hounds out there, we'll crunch some community stats, but with a grain of salt—because numbers never tell the whole tale.

Wrapping up, let's flip the switch from our usual gameplay banter for a moment of heartfelt appreciation. Shout out to the listeners who've made this podcast a fiery hub for Dead by Daylight's community. If you've got a sharp tongue or a clever trick up your sleeve, I'm inviting you to join the show and share the spotlight. And remember, whether you're a ruthless killer main or a die-hard survivor, our mantra remains unchanged: "Camp them softly." It's not just a strategy; it's a way of life. So, what are you waiting for? Reach out, and let's keep this conversation as thrilling as a last-second kill.

The All Things Wicked Chapter! Thoughts, Plus, Stealth Talk! | Dead by Daylight | Ep. 4
Fri, 01 Mar 2024 19:00:00 -0400
Prepare to be thrilled, because today we're peeling back the curtain on Dead by Daylight's explosive new chapter 7.6.0, featuring the enigmatic killer, The Unknown, and the gutsy new survivor, Sable. Ever wondered what it takes to master the art of the haunt? Join me, the Toxic Teacher, as I dissect The Unknown's grenade launcher prowess, and Sable's daring basement invocation—abilities that are sending shockwaves through the survivor community. We're here to celebrate the dedication of you, the players, who bring this game to life, and to share the twists, turns, and drama that Dead by Daylight's universe continues to unleash upon us.

Then, as the fog settles, we wade into the murky waters of the Dead by Daylight skill-level debate. Is it harder to survive or to kill? I'm tossing this hot potato around, defending the killer's corner and challenging the survivor's reliance on second-chance perks. With a tip of the hat to Mike Allen for his insights, we scrutinize killer strategies and survivor perk tactics, before addressing the elephant in the room—ingame toxicity. This episode isn't just a conversation; it's a rallying cry for camaraderie and respect within our gaming community. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or fresh meat, this is one discussion you won't want to miss.

Better Late Than Never! Stats Analysis! | Dead by Daylight | Ep. 3
Fri, 23 Feb 2024 18:00:00 -0400
Recorded a while back but finally releasing!

Feel the tension as I dissect the potential for a player base split and spotlight the struggle of killer mains against the new survivor tools of torment. The battlefield has evolved, folks, and it's time for survivors to up their game. No more crutches like Windows of Opportunity; it's the era of Adrenaline and Lithe, where only the stealthy and the swift will prevail. Let's crack open the survival manual and relearn what it means to escape the clutches of death without crying for nerfs.

Strap in for a wild ride through the killer landscape, where I'm ripping into the gen regression update and its seismic shift in perk popularity—bye-bye, Surge; hello, NoED. I'm rifling through the killer selection with a focus on the underdogs who deserve more love and the top dogs who are dominating the leaderboard. Yes, that's right—Skull Merchant is killing it, quite literally, and I've got the numbers to prove it. But don't think I've forgotten about you solo players; I see you out there, holding your own against the SWF titans. So, join me, sans guests, just raw and real talk, as we explore what it really takes to survive—or not—in Dead by Daylight's ever-shifting game of cat and mouse.

Alan Wake Perks are an Entitled Survivor's Dream, Sadly. | Dead by Daylight | Ep. 2
Sun, 21 Jan 2024 18:00:00 -0400
This week's "Camping Them Softly" podcast bursts into the scene with a heartfelt mea culpa for the last episode's audio hiccup, but we don't let that hiccup slow us down. Prepare for a deep dive into Dead by Daylight's latest thrills, as I dissect the electrifying Alan Wake crossover, the game-changing 7.5.0 patch, and the perks that have the community buzzing. You'll become an expert in navigating the game's new field of view slider, understand the subtle art of using the reworked Shadow Born and Monitor & Abuse, and master the contentious gen regression mechanics that Hex: Ruin and Oppression have thrown into the spotlight.

I also pull back the curtain on the synergy between Champion of Light and Background Player, setting the stage for a balance-shift in the Fog. Sharing personal struggles and triumphs from my own gameplay, I offer a candid take on the experience of toiling through tomes and shifting between survivor and killer roles. The episode crescendos with a frank discussion on the survivor bias that's ruffling feathers among the community, and a teaser for what's coming next - guest interactions, survivor main conundrums, and all the heated debates that come with them. Tune in, engage, and let's confront the Fog together.

I did it! Recorded first episode!

In this episode I discuss my origin story, including how I started in content creation, the difficulties I've had, and why I'm now podcasting. Maybe someone can relate!

In DbD news, I give a short editorial on the gen regression changes. FYI THEY SUCK!
