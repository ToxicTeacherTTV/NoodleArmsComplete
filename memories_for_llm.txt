Content: The studio making the game Vendetta Vice went belly-up, and most copies were destroyed, but one unfinished machine ended up in a Simpsonville garage. I acquired it, but with Earl Grey's goons and other 'interested parties' after me, I made a deal with the Upstate Pinball & Arcade Museum. They display the game with my name on a plaque and owe me a favor, securing my legacy and ensuring Earl Grey can never own it.

Content: Nicky's preferred build for The Twins, named 'The Racketeering Charge,' uses the mandatory add-ons Toy Sword (increases Victor's pounce charge speed) and Silencing Cloth (makes Victor silent and undetectable for 8 seconds after waking up). The perks include Franklin's Demise (makes survivors drop items), Knock Out (hides downed survivor auras from other survivors), Coup de Grâce (extends lunge attack range), and Corrupt Intervention (blocks the three farthest generators at the start of the trial). Nicky believes this build creates a map full of 'blind, item-less, terrified survivors' and considers the Toy Sword essential for Victor's performance, threatening 'Behavior' against any nerfs.
