# Memory Corruption Incident Report

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** IDENTIFIED & MITIGATED

---

## üö® Executive Summary

The entire memory system (1,505 memories) was built using **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, which multi-model testing revealed to be completely unreliable for fact extraction and reasoning tasks. This resulted in hallucinated facts, missing critical information (e.g., SABAM roster), and incorrect importance scoring.

---

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Memory Creation Timeline
- **Oct 3-11, 2025**: All memories created during "Flash era"
- **Total Affected**: 1,505 memories across 35+ source documents
- **Key Documents Corrupted**:
  - `nickyalldocs-301-600.pdf` (346 memories)
  - `denteverse_bible_chatgpt_2025-06-30.pdf` (236 memories)
  - `nickyalldocs-2-300.pdf` (198 memories)
  - SABAM roster, character profiles, lore documents (all affected)

### Confirmed Issues
1. **Missing Core Facts**: Nicky doesn't "know" SABAM members exist despite 50+ related documents
2. **Hallucinated Information**: Flash invents facts not present in source material
3. **Wrong Importance Scores**: Critical facts scored low, trivial facts scored high
4. **Poor Keyword Extraction**: Semantic gaps prevent proper memory retrieval

## üß™ Model Testing Results

### Gemini 2.5 Flash (BANNED)
- ‚ùå Math question: Paranoid rant instead of answer
- ‚ùå Killer advice: Wrong answer (Ghostface for beginners - actually high skill cap)
- ‚ùå Weather query: Conspiracy theory nonsense
- ‚ùå Fact extraction: Invents information, misses critical details
- **Verdict: UNUSABLE - Delete from codebase**

### Gemini 2.5 Pro (FREE, APPROVED)
- ‚úÖ Answers questions accurately
- ‚úÖ Gives proper advice (Trapper/Wraith for beginners)
- ‚úÖ Creative but coherent responses
- ‚úÖ Good enough for fact extraction
- **Verdict: Use for document processing and background tasks**

### Claude Sonnet 4.5 (PAID, PRIMARY)
- ‚úÖ Perfect personality adherence
- ‚úÖ Highest quality responses
- ‚úÖ Best reasoning and context awareness
- **Verdict: Use for all user-facing conversations**

## üîß Immediate Fixes Applied

### 1. Banned Flash from Fallback (Oct 14, 2025)
```typescript
// server/services/gemini.ts Line 536
const models = ["gemini-2.5-pro"]; // ‚ùå NEVER USE FLASH
```

### 2. Enhanced Credit Exhaustion Warnings
```typescript
// server/services/anthropic.ts Line 1039-1045
console.error(`üö® ANTHROPIC CREDITS EXHAUSTED - FALLING BACK TO GEMINI PRO`);
console.error(`   ‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This fallback uses Gemini Pro (NOT Flash)`);
```

### 3. Document Processing Already Fixed
- ‚úÖ `extractStoriesFromDocument()` uses Pro
- ‚úÖ `extractAtomicFactsFromStory()` uses Pro
- ‚úÖ `extractFactsFromDocument()` uses Pro
- ‚úÖ All consolidation/deduplication uses Pro

### 4. Short-term Workaround: Bridging Memory
Created protected fact (importance 999) linking semantic concepts:
```
"SABAM members are Nicky's chosen family - the crew includes Uncle Gnocchi, 
Mama Marinara, Marco 'The Mouse' Pepperoni, Bruno 'The Basement' Bolognese, 
Sofia 'Speed Run' Spaghetti, The Ravioli Twins, The Fettuccine Five, and Big Ziti"

Keywords: ['family', 'SABAM', 'members', 'organization', 'gaming', 'crew']
```

## üìã Reprocessing Plan (RECOMMENDED)

### Option A: Nuclear (Start Fresh)
1. **Backup**: `CREATE TABLE memory_entries_backup_flash AS SELECT * FROM memory_entries`
2. **Delete All**: `DELETE FROM memory_entries WHERE profile_id = 'nicky-id'`
3. **Re-upload Documents**: Use Gemini Pro to reprocess all 35+ documents
4. **Verify Quality**: Check importance scores, keywords, fact accuracy

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Clean slate with reliable model
- ‚úÖ Consistent quality across all memories
- ‚úÖ Proper importance scoring

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Time intensive (35+ documents to reprocess)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May lose some manually added memories
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires careful document re-upload

### Option B: Surgical (Keep Manual, Replace Auto)
1. **Backup**: Same as above
2. **Delete Only Document Memories**: 
```sql
DELETE FROM memory_entries 
WHERE profile_id = 'nicky-id'
  AND created_at >= '2025-10-03'  -- Flash era start
  AND source LIKE '%.pdf'         -- Document sources only
```
3. **Re-upload Core Documents**: Focus on SABAM, character profiles, lore
4. **Verify**: Check that manual/system memories preserved

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves manual entries
- ‚úÖ Faster than nuclear option
- ‚úÖ Less risk of data loss

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May leave some Flash corruption
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to identify which memories are "safe"

### Option C: Gradual (Live with Workarounds)
1. **Keep Current Memories**: Accept some corruption
2. **Add Bridging Facts**: Manually create high-importance facts for critical gaps
3. **Implement Vector Embeddings**: Use semantic search to work around keyword gaps
4. **Reprocess New Documents Only**: Use Pro for all future uploads

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No disruption to current system
- ‚úÖ Gradual quality improvement
- ‚úÖ Learning opportunity

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Corruption remains in knowledge base
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May surface incorrect facts in conversations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires ongoing manual fixes

## üéØ Recommended Strategy

**HYBRID APPROACH:**
1. **Immediate** (Done):
   - ‚úÖ Ban Flash from all code paths
   - ‚úÖ Add prominent credit warnings
   - ‚úÖ Create bridging memory for SABAM

2. **Short Term** (This Week):
   - Implement vector embeddings for semantic search (schema ready)
   - Reprocess 5-10 most critical documents with Pro
   - Add more bridging facts for known gaps

3. **Medium Term** (Next 2 Weeks):
   - Gradual reprocessing of all documents during low-usage periods
   - Build document quality validation system
   - Create "memory health check" dashboard

4. **Long Term** (Next Month):
   - Full vector embedding implementation
   - Automated duplicate/contradiction detection
   - Memory confidence scoring system

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### Model Selection Rules
```
‚úÖ Conversations/Responses ‚Üí Claude Sonnet 4.5 (expensive, best)
‚úÖ Document Processing ‚Üí Gemini Pro (free, reliable)
‚úÖ Memory Consolidation ‚Üí Gemini Pro (free, reliable)
‚ùå Nothing Ever ‚Üí Gemini Flash (banned, unreliable)
```

### Code Enforcement
- Flash model name removed from all service files
- Fallback explicitly uses Pro only
- Document processing hardcoded to Pro
- Clear comments marking Flash as banned

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics track model usage
- Console warnings on credit exhaustion
- Log which model generates each memory (future enhancement)

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Test Models Thoroughly**: Multi-model testing revealed Flash's unreliability
2. **Track Model Metadata**: Should store which model created each memory
3. **Validate Quality**: Need automated checks for fact accuracy
4. **Budget Monitoring**: Add alerts before credit exhaustion
5. **Semantic Search Needed**: Keyword-only retrieval has fundamental limits
