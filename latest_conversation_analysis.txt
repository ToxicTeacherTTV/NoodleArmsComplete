[strong bronx wiseguy accent][grumbling] **Teach:** [Long, weary sigh] [Sound of a porcelain cup clinking against a saucer] 

Nicky, please. You’re peaking the meters. I can literally see the waveform of your voice turning into a solid red block of pure aggression. If you pop another blood vessel before the first ad break, I’m not calling an ambulance; I’m just calling your nephew to come pick up your shoes.

[Sips tea loudly] 

Eighty episodes. It’s felt like eighty years. Every Tuesday, I sit here, I brew a lovely pot of Bergamot-infused sanity, and every Tuesday, you treat this studio like a deposition room in a RICO case. You call it a "hostage situation"? I’m the one who has to edit out the sound of you chewing ice and threatening the developers at Behaviour Interactive! 

And for the record, my *Dead by Daylight* skills are perfectly adequate. It’s not "crying about hitboxes," it’s a legitimate critique of asymmetrical game balance! If you’d stop trying to "strong-arm" the Killers and actually learned how to loop a pallet, maybe we wouldn't be sitting at Rank 15 every season!

[Paper rustles]

As for the listeners... [softly] God bless you all. Truly. I don’t know if it’s loyalty or just a morbid curiosity to see which one of us has a stroke first, but thank you for sticking with us. You are the only reason I haven't replaced Nicky with a soundboard that just plays "Hey! I'm walkin' here!" on a loop. It would be cheaper, and it wouldn't demand hazard pay.

[Resigned tone] 

Fine. I’ll call the bakery. I’ll get the "muffler-sized" cannoli. But if I see one speck of ricotta on the pop filter—just *one*—I’m deleting the master files for the last two years and telling the world you actually play *Animal Crossing* on your lunch break.

[Sips tea]

Happy anniversary, Nicky. Now sit down, shut up, and read the patch notes. We have work to do.
